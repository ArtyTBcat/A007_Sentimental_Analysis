            "Remember when \"web3 gaming\" was the hot new thing in the game industry? In 2022,it seemed like every other game makerwas flirting with \"NFT integration\" or \"blockchain support\" or some other crypto-adjacent buzzword in one form or another. Then, throughout 2023, the whole ideaquickly faded awayas generative AI becamethe latest Silicon Valley obsession.",
            "But some are apparently not willing to give up on the crypto gaming dream. Playtron and Mysten Labs haveannouncedtheSuiPlay0X1, a new Steam Deck-alike that is being billed as \"the world's first blockchain native handheld games console.\"",
            "BREAKING: announcement from onstage at#SuiBasecamp: we\u2019re excited to share the first handheld gaming device with native Web3 capabilities \u2013 the SuiPlay0X1, powered by@PLAYTR0N!pic.twitter.com/Zubhx6gyXG",
            "\u2014 Sui (@SuiNetwork)April 10, 2024",
            "Currently, the device seems to exist only as a few concept renders and vague promises about finally making \"web3 gaming\" accessible to the ignorant masses who don't even know how much they need crypto features integrated into their gaming portable. But even if those promises all pan out (a very big if), it's hard to see any real value that the 0X1 would provide over the current slate of gaming handhelds.",
            "Very briefly, for those who have blessedly been able to ignore it, \"web3 gaming\" is an amorphous concept that captures pretty much any game that has some sort of connection to blockchain technology and/or cryptocurrency. For the SuiPlay 0X1, that means tight integration withthe Sui blockchain, which claims lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and easier scalability than some other crypto coins.",
            "By using Sui, the 0X1's makers promise the portable will have \"the simplicity of being able to set up a [crypto] wallet like signing up with your Google account,\" a comparison that makes us wonder why they didn't just make an Android-based system that integrates with our existing Google accounts.",
            "Enlarge/MTG: Onlinelet you buy trade digital collectibles years before the blockchain was even a thing (and still does to this day).WotCThe creators of the 0X1 claim that blockchain integration allows for \"asset ownership directly connected to a device's account system for the first time in gaming history.\" While that might be technically true for the crypto-maximalist version of \"own,\" it's important to note that the Steam account tied to your Steam Deck will already let you easilybuy and sell items from the Steam community marketin your local fiat currency. The makers also promise that \"users can transfer assets freely between each other without ever thinking about crypto or wallet addresses,\" something that has beenpossible on a centralized platform likeMagic the Gathering: Onlinefor decades, to name just one example.",
            "",
            "Web3 gaming advocates would claim that having these in-game assets tracked on a blockchain, rather than through some centralized game publisher's database, means you have fuller control over your \"unique\" gaming items. But any continuing value of these items still relies on them being usable in a gaming context, as owners of Ubisoft'sGhost Recon BreakpointNFTs found onceUbisoft quickly ended support for the game itself.",
            "Inan interview with Decrypt, Mysten Labs Chief Product Officer Adeniyi Abiodun said that the 0X1's crypto integration will let game makers offer free tokens, assets, and other on-chain rewards and discounts to lure players to try out new games. They also nodded toward the possibility for some sort of token drop for all 0X1 owners that would help \"subsidize\" the cost of the device itself.",
            "",
            "Speaking of games store, Playtron boldly claims that the 0X1 will be able to \"play everything from every store\" through a \"single launcher\" inthe upcoming Linux-based PlaytronOS. Playtron is \"attempting to extract the PC gaming ecosystem from Windows and recontextualize in our own operating system,\" CEO Kirt McMastertold VentureBeat.",
            "",
            "As for Playtron's promise that 0X1 users can \"buy any game with your digital currency\" using \"payments that aren't encumbered with traditional payment rails,\" we'll just note that Valvestopped accepting bitcoin for payments in 2017because price volatility and transaction fees made it unworkable. Maybe Sui has fixed these problems, but so far, evidence suggests that cryptocurrency is still more useful as a speculative asset than an everyday payment option.",
            "Without even vague gestures toward key details like specs, price, or planned release date (beyond \"2025\"), it's hard to even evaluate how the 0X1 would work as a gaming device. When it comes to the supposedly revolutionary promise of web3 gaming, though, it's very hard to see the new features appealing to anyone but the most diehard of crypto fanatics.",

            "As the United States reimposes oil sanctions on Venezuela, the country\u2019s state-run oil company PDVSA is planning to increase its reliance on digital currencies for crude and fuel exports,according to a recent Reuters report.",
            "The U.S. Treasury Department recently declined to renew a general license, giving PDVSA\u2019s customers and providers until May 31 to wind down transactions. This move is expected tohinder Venezuela\u2019s efforts to increase oil output and exports, as companies will need to obtain individual U.S. authorizations to do business with the country.",
            "Since last year, PDVSA has been gradually shifting oil sales to USDT, also known as Tether, a digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar. The return of oil sanctions is accelerating this shift, as PDVSA aims to reduce the risk of sale proceeds being frozen in foreign bank accounts due to the measures.",
            "Venezuelan oil minister Pedro Tellechea acknowledged the use of different currencies in contracts, noting that digital currencies might be the preferred payment method in some cases:",
            "We have different currencies, according to what is stated in contracts. [\u2026] USDT transactions, as PDVSA is demanding them to be, don\u2019t pass any trader\u2019s compliance department, so the only way to make it work is working with an intermediary.",
            "Despite the U.S. dollar being the preferred currency for global oil market transactions, PDVSA has been moving many spot oil deals to a contract model that requires prepayment for half of each cargo\u2019s value in USDT. The company wants new customers to hold cryptocurrency in a digital wallet, even in some old contracts that do not explicitly state the use of USDT.",
            "The recent U.S. license allowed trading houses and former PDVSA customers to resume business with Venezuela, but most of them have resorted to intermediaries to meet the digital transaction requirements.",
            "While increasingly relying on middlemen for transactions could help PDVSA circumvent sanctions, it will likely result in a smaller portion of oil proceeds reaching the company\u2019s coffers.",
            "Minister Tellechea remains optimistic about Venezuela\u2019s oil industry, stating that PDVSA has \u201ca big strength in trading\u201d and is prepared to address the return of U.S. sanctions. However, oil analysts expect that even with prompt individual authorizations from Washington, Venezuela\u2019s oil output, exports, and revenue will soon hit a ceiling.",
            "Tether\u2019s USDT is the most popular stablecoin, with a market cap of nearly $110 billionaccording to CoinMarketCap data. The currency is seeing a lot of use among crypto users as a way to skirt volatility, but also by other parties that see traditional financial institutions as hostile to their industries.",
            "The United Nations also raisedconcerns that USDT is increasingly used by money launderers.",

            "A jury has unanimously convicted Avi Eisenberg in the US Department of Justice's first case involving cryptocurrency open-market manipulation, the DOJannouncedThursday.",
            "The jury found Eisenberg guilty of commodities fraud, commodities market manipulation, and wire fraud in connection with the manipulation on a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets.",
            "Eisenberg is scheduled to be sentenced on July 29 and is facing \"a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on the commodities fraud count and the commodities manipulation count, and a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the wire fraud count,\" the DOJ said.",
            "On the Mango Markets exchange, Eisenberg was \"engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain approximately $110 million worth of cryptocurrency from Mango Markets and its customers by artificially manipulating the price of certain perpetual futures contracts,\" the DOJ said. The scheme impacted both investors trading and the exchange itself, which had to suspend operations after Eisenberg's attack made the exchange insolvent.",
            "Nicole M. Argentieri, the principal deputy assistant attorney general who heads the DOJ's criminal division, said that Eisenberg's manipulative trading scheme \"puts our financial markets and investors at risk.\"",
            "\"This prosecution\u2014the first involving the manipulation of cryptocurrency through open-market trades\u2014demonstrates the Criminal Division\u2019s commitment to protecting US financial markets and holding wrongdoers accountable, no matter what mechanism they use to commit manipulation and fraud,\u201d Argentieri said.",
            "Mango Labs has similarly sued Eisenberg over the price manipulation scheme, but that lawsuit was stayed until the DOJ's case was resolved. Mango Labs is expecting a status update today from the US government and is hoping to proceed with its lawsuit.",
            "Ars could not immediately reach Mango Labs for comment.",
            "Eisenberg's lawyer, Brian Klein, provided the same statement to Ars, confirming that Eisenberg's legal team is \"obviously disappointed\" but \"will keep fighting for our client.\"",
            "Mango Labs has accused Eisenberg of being a \"notorious cryptocurrency market manipulator,\" noting in itscomplaintthat he has a \"history of attacking multiple cryptocurrency platforms and manipulating cryptocurrency markets.\" That history includes allegedly embezzling $14 million in 2021 while Eisenberg was working as a developer for another decentralized marketplace called Fortress, Mango Labs' complaint said.",
            "Eisenberg's attack on Mango Markets intended to grab tens of millions more than the alleged Fortress attack. When Eisenberg was first charged, the DOJexplainedhow his Mango Markets price manipulation scheme worked.",
            "On Mango Markets, investors can \"purchase and borrow cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related financial products,\" including buying and selling \"perpetual futures contracts.\"",
            "\"When an investor buys or sells a perpetual for a particular cryptocurrency, the investor is not buying or selling that cryptocurrency but is, instead, buying or selling exposure to future movements in the value of that cryptocurrency relative to another cryptocurrency,\" the DOJ explained.",

            "It wasn't until 2017 that the London-based millennial began investing in crypto tokens, he told Business Insider via email.",
            "\"I was really interested inRippleand decided to invest,\" said Bill, whose identity is known to BI but has been withheld because of his fear of professional repercussions. \"I then boughtStellar,bitcoinandEthereum.\"",
            "Bill said most of his investment gains came from Ripple and Stellar. Between December 2020 and April 2021, when the prices of both tokens were near their recent peaks of about$1.60and$0.54, respectively, he started cashing out. Bill sold roughly $30,000 (or \u20ac28,000) worth of Ripple and Stellar, according to documents viewed by BI. He estimated that he invested between $6,000 and $7,000 in these tokens and that his average returnacross the sales was over 300%.",
            "Last year, shortly after turning 30, he said he put these proceeds toward the purchase of a $350,000(or\u00a3280,000) apartment in London.",
            "Bill is among the millions of people across the world who have invested in cryptocurrencies. Whilesomeof these investorslost money\u2014 particularly whentoken values plunged in 2022\u2014 others have benefited from a surge in crypto prices in recent months.",
            "In February, the total value of the cryptocurrency marketreached $2 trillionfor the first time since April 2022. In March, the price of bitcoinhit $66,000for the first time in nearly three years and reached a record high ofover $73,000. While bitcoin is now tradingaround $70,000, it remains well above the roughly $16,000 it plummeted to in November 2022. The prices of some other tokens, includingEthereumandSolana, have also risen considerably over the past year.",

            "Experts have pointed to theprospect of lower interest rates, growing demand forbitcoin ETFs, and the upcomingbitcoin halving event\u2014 when the number of bitcoin tokens rewarded to miners will be cut in half\u2014as explanations for the crypto market's strong performance in recent months.",
            "While some crypto investors are likely to bet onprices rising even more, others, like Bill,might start selling some of their proceeds. This could beamong the reasonsthe price of bitcoin has fallen from its March peak.",
            "Bill, who works as an M&A professional, said the first step in his crypto-investing strategy was to buy tokens he believed in. He said these tended to beutility tokenslikeRippleandEthereum, which are created \u2014rather than mined\u2014 and typicallyprovide accessto services or products within a blockchain ecosystem. They're distinct fromsecurity tokens, which effectively function as investment assets like stocks.",
            "He said he tried to make his investments when prices were falling and then deployed adollar-cost averagingapproach, which involved making a series of investments over time in the hopes of decreasing the average costof his investment.",
            "When prices rose to what Bill thought were their near-term peaks \u2014 and he'd made a good return on his investment \u2014 he started selling his tokens in batches over a given period of time.",
            "\"I tend to do a first sale to cover my investment and then do a few more transactions until I fully exited the position,\" he said. \"I mostly look at the market sentiment and charts to ascertain where we are in the cycle.\"",
            "While he's had some success as a crypto investor, Bill doesn't consider himself an expert.",
            "\"I simply follow this strategy which is highly based on the belief that the markets will go up long-term, and the tokens that I believe in won't lose value,\" he said.",

            "More than two months after the start of a ransomware debacle whose impact ranks among the worst in the history of cybersecurity, the medical firm Change Healthcare finally confirmed what cybercriminals, security researchers, and Bitcoin's blockchain had already made all too clear: that it did indeedpay a ransom to the hackers who targeted the companyin February. And yet, it still faces the risk of losing vast amounts of customers' sensitive medical data.",
            "In a statement sent to WIRED and other news outlets on Monday evening, Change Healthcare wrote that it paid a ransom to a cybercriminal group extorting the company, a hacker gang known as AlphV or BlackCat. \u201cA ransom was paid as part of the company\u2019s commitment to do all it could to protect patient data from disclosure,\u201d the statement reads. The company's belated admission of that payment accompanied anew post on its websitewhere it warns that the hackers may have stolen health-related data that would \u201ccover a substantial proportion of people in America.\u201d",
            "Cybersecurity and cryptocurrency researchers told WIRED last month that Change Healthcareappeared to have paid that ransom on March 1, pointing to a transaction of 350 bitcoins or roughly $22 million sent into a crypto wallet associated with the AlphV hackers. That transaction was first highlighted in a message on a Russian cybercriminal forum known as RAMP, where one of AlphV's allegedly jilted partners complained that they hadn't received their cut of Change Healthcare's payment. However, for weeks following that transaction, which was publicly visible on Bitcoin's blockchain and which both security firm Recorded Future and blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs told WIRED had been received by AlphV, Change Healthcare repeatedly declined to confirm that it had paid the ransom.",
            "Change Healthcare's confirmation of that extortion payment puts new weight behind the cybersecurity industry's fears that the attack\u2014and the profit AlphV extracted from it\u2014will lead ransomware gangs to further target health care companies. \u201cIt 100 percent encourages other actors to target health care organizations,\u201d Jon DiMaggio, a researcher with cybersecurity firm Analyst1 who focuses on ransomware, told WIRED at the time the transaction was first spotted in March. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one of the industries wedon\u2019twant ransomware actors to target\u2014especially when it affects hospitals.\u201d",
            "Compounding the situation, a conflict between hackers in the ransomware ecosystem has led to asecondransomware group claiming to possess Change Healthcare's stolen data andthreatening to sell it to the highest bidder on the dark web. Earlier this month that second group, known as RansomHub, sent WIRED alleged samples of the stolen data that appeared to come from Change Healthcare's network, including patient records and a contract with another health care company.",
            "As of Monday, strangely, the listing for that data on RansomHub's dark-web site had been taken down. Change Healthcare's post to its website, however, warns that 22 screenshots of its data had been posted to the dark web by an unnamed hacker group, and that they included \u201cprotected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII),\u201d though it said it hadn't seen any sign that medical records like doctor's charts or full medical histories for any patients were among the stolen data.",

            "For Change Healthcare and the beleaguered medical practices, hospitals, and patients that depend on it, the confirmation of its extortion payment to the hackers adds a bitter coda to an already dystopian story. AlphV's digital paralysis of Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, snarled the insurance approval of prescriptions and medical procedures for hundreds of medical practices and hospitals across the country, making it by some measures the most widespread medical ransomware disruption ever. A survey of American Medical Association members conducted between March 26 and April 3 found that four out of five clinicians had lost revenue as a result of the crisis. Many said they were using their own personal finances to cover a practice\u2019s expenses. Change Healthcare, meanwhile,says it has lost $872 million to the incidentand projects that number to rise well over a billion in the longer term.",
            "Change Healthcare's confirmation of its ransom payment now appears to show that much of that catastrophic fallout for the US health care system unfoldedafterit had already paid the hackers an exorbitant sum\u2014a payment in exchange for a decryption key for the systems the hackers had encrypted and a promise not to leak the company's stolen data. As is often the case in ransomware attacks, AlphV's disruption of its systems appears to have been so widespread that Change Healthcare's recovery process has extended long after it obtained the decryption key designed to unlock its systems.",
            "As ransomware payments go, $22 million wouldn't be the most that a victim has forked over. But it's close, says Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused security researcher who spoke to WIRED about the suspected payment in March. Only a few rare payments, such as the $40 million paid to hackers by CNA Financial in 2021, top that number. \u201cIt\u2019s not without precedent, but it\u2019s certainly very unusual,\u201d Callow said of the $22 million figure.",
            "That $22 million injection of funds into the ransomware ecosystem further fuels a vicious cycle that has reached epidemic proportions. Cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis found that in 2023, ransomware victims paid the hackers targeting themfully $1.1 billion, a new record. Change Healthcare's payment may represent only a small drop in that bucket, but it both rewards AlphV for its highly damaging attacks and may suggest to other ransomware groups that health care companies are particularly profitable targets, given those companies are especially sensitive to both the high cost of those cyberattacks financially and the risks they pose to patients' health.",
            "Compounding Change Healthcare's mess is an apparent double-cross within the ransomware underground: AlphV, by all appearances, faked its own law enforcement takedown after receiving Change Healthcare's payment in an attempt to avoid sharing it with its so-called affiliates, the hackers who partner with the group to penetrate victims on its behalf. The second ransomware group threatening Change Healthcare, RansomHub, now claims to WIRED that they obtained the stolen data from those affiliates, who still want to be paid for their work.",
            "That has created a situation where Change Healthcare's payment provides little assurance that its compromised data won't still be exploited by disgruntled hackers. \u201cThese affiliates work for multiple groups. They\u2019re concerned with getting paid themselves, and there\u2019s no trust among thieves,\u201d Analyst1's DiMaggio told WIRED in March. \u201cIf someone screws someone else, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do with the data.\u201d",
            "All of that means Change Healthcare still has little assurance that it has avoided an even worse scenario than it has yet faced: paying what may be one of the biggest ransoms in history and still seeing its data spilled onto the dark web. \u201cIf it gets leaked after they paid $22 million, it\u2019s pretty much like setting that money on fire,\u201d DiMaggio warned in March. \u201cThey\u2019d have burned that money for nothing.\u201d",

            "In a recentinterview with the Wall Street Journal, the bank\u2019s chief investment officer, Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, stated that Bitcoin is not considered an investment asset class and that the bank does not believe in cryptocurrencies. Mossavar-Rahmani questioned the value of Bitcoin:",
            "If you cannot assign a value, then how can you be bullish or bearish?",
            "Mossavar-Rahmani also stated that customers have not expressed interest in crypto. The bank officially launched its crypto trading desk in 2021 and has been facilitating various Bitcoin-linked trades, including Bitcoin non-deliverable futures and CME BTC futures. Still, the bank does not interact with the cryptocurrencies directly.",
            "Max Minton, Goldman\u2019s Asia Pacific head of digital assets,noted in an interviewthat the recent approval of ETFs has reignited interest and activity among the bank\u2019s clients. Many clients are either currently active in the crypto space or are considering entering it, with a noticeable increase in client interest, onboarding, pipeline, and trading volume since the beginning of the year.",
            "Despite Mossavar-Rahmani\u2019s public skepticism, Goldman Sachs has been quietly dabbling in the cryptocurrency market. In 2021, it was reported that the bank, along with ICAP, JPMorgan, and UBS, hadbought the first exchange-traded product(ETP) in Europe that offered exposure to Polkadot\u2019s DOT cryptocurrency for clients.",
            "The report follows Bitcoin recentlysoaring past $71,000for the first time in history following an approval for crypto exchange-traded products by the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority.",
            "The recent updraft that took Bitcoin\u2019s price higher and higher took hold after the U.S.\u2019sapprovalof spot Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) back in January, propelling the cryptocurrency to breach the $70,000 mark last week for the first time. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) surpassed the $4,000 milestone on Monday.Now companies are looking to do the same with Ethereum.",

            "The exchange, which provides institutional clients with access to over 30 perpetual futures and spot markets, will add these new perpetual futures contracts, also known as perpetual swaps. The Ordinals perpetual futures will trade under the ticker ORDI-PERP, while Worldcoin will trade under WLD-PERP.",
            "Worldcoin, founded by OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania in 2019, aims to become the world\u2019s largest privacy-preserving human identity and financial network. Its native token, WLD, serves as a utility token with governance properties, allowing users to have a say in the future development of the protocol.",

            "Perpetual futures, or perpetual swaps, are derivative financial instruments commonly traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures do not have an expiration date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they maintain the required margin and meet exchange requirements. These contracts mimic the price of the underlying asset, typically a cryptocurrency, and settle periodically to the spot price.",
            "To prevent significant deviations between the perpetual futures price and the spot price, exchanges use a funding mechanism. Funding payments are made between long and short positions to help maintain the perpetual futures price in line with the spot price.",
            "Traders use perpetual futures for various purposes, including speculation, hedging, and arbitrage. However, it is crucial to note that trading perpetual futures carries significant risks, such as high volatility and the potential for liquidation if margin requirements are not maintained.",
            "The announcement follows Bitcoinexperiencing a significant surgeon April 4, gaining over $4,000 in a single day as traders anticipated potential short liquidations. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price reached a high of over $69,000, but as of press time is trading at $66,830 marking a 0.74% increase and pushing its market capitalization to $1.31 trillion.",

            "In a startling development, US prosecutors are pushing for a 36-month prison term for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, according to a court filing on Tuesday. Zhao, who stepped down as CEO but retains majority ownership of the company, is due for sentencing on April 30 in Seattleafter pleading guilty in Novemberto violating US anti-money laundering regulations.",
            "As part of his plea deal, Zhao agreed to pay a $50 million fine, while Binance offered to pay $4.3 billion in fines and compensation. However, prosecutors are now seeking a harsher punishment than the 18 months initially recommended by federal sentencing guidelines, arguing that the severity of Zhao\u2019s willful breach of US law and its ramifications warrant an above-Guidelines sentence.",
            "Zhao reaped vast rewards for his violation of US law, [\u2026] and the price of that violation must be significant to effectively punish Zhao for his criminal acts and to deter others who are tempted to build fortunes and business empires by breaking US law.",
            "Prosecutors allege that Zhao failed to implement a robust anti-money laundering (AML) program at Binance, enabling illicit actors to exploit the exchange for activities such as operating mixing services to conceal the origins of cryptocurrency. Additionally, Binance allegedly facilitated transactions between Iranian and US customers, undermining US sanctions against Iran and potentially jeopardizing the exchange\u2019s liquidity.",
            "In February, a settlement addressed significant operational deficiencies within Binance, including the platform\u2019s failure to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions linked to designated terrorist organizations like Hamas, al Qaeda, and ISIS. The exchange also faced allegations of facilitating transactions related to child sexual abuse materials and proceeds from ransomware activities.",
            "Despite the legal challenges, Zhao\u2019s personal fortune has grown by nearly $10 billion over the past year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with his current wealth exceeding $42 billion and ranking him as the 29th wealthiest individual worldwide.",
            "The outcome of Zhao\u2019s sentencing hearing on April 30 will undoubtedly have significant implications for both the cryptocurrency industry and the broader financial landscape, as regulators and law enforcement agencies continue to grapple with the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving digital asset space.",
            "Zhao is not the only Binance official currently in trouble. After Binancehalted its services in Nigeriaat the beginning of March two company representativeswere arrested in the country, which was followed by the firmissuing a statement requesting their release.",

            "Sam Shedden is an experienced journalist and editor with over a decade of experience in online news. A seasoned technology writer and content strategist, he\u2026",
            "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicts crypto market to double to $5 trillion.Factors include ETF approval and upcoming Bitcoin halving event.Positive regulatory momentum and institutional interest contribute to optimism.",
            "Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market are poised for significant growth this year, predicts Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of blockchain startup Ripple.",
            "In a recent interview with CNBC, Garlinghouse predicted that the total market capitalization of the crypto industry could double to $5 trillion by the end of 2023.",
            "Garlinghouse pointed to several macroeconomic factors driving this bullish outlook, including the recent approval of the first U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the upcoming Bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d event. The spot ETFs, which began trading on U.S. stock exchanges in January after being approved by the SEC, allow both institutions and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the digital asset.",
            "Meanwhile, the Bitcoin halving, a technical event occurring roughly every four years that cuts the mining reward in half, is expected to take place later this month and could further constrict supply while demand grows. Garlinghouse told CNBC:",
            "I\u2019ve been around this industry for a long time, and I\u2019ve seen these trends come and go. [\u2026] I\u2019m very optimistic. I think the macro trends, the big-picture things like the ETFs, they\u2019re driving for the first time real institutional money.",
            "The cryptocurrency market has already seen impressive gains over the past year, with Bitcoin rising more than 140% and hitting a record high above $73,000 in March before pulling back. As the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, accounting for about 49% of the entire crypto market\u2019s value, Bitcoin\u2019s performance heavily influences the broader digital asset space.",
            "Beyond the technical and macroeconomic drivers, Garlinghouse also sees positive regulatory momentum in the U.S. as a potential catalyst for the crypto market this year. With 2023 being an election year, there is optimism that the next administration may take a more accommodative stance toward the industry.",
            "This comes despite the current SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, taking an aggressive enforcement approach against crypto companies, including Ripple itself which is fighting a lawsuit alleging it illegally sold its XRP token as an unregistered security.",
            "One of the things actually I\u2019ll say on the macro tail winds for the industry: I think we will get more clarity in the United States. [\u2026] The U.S. is still the largest economy in the world, and it\u2019s unfortunately been one of the more hostile crypto markets. And I think that\u2019s going to start to change, also.\u201d",
            "Garlinghouse is not alone in his bullish predictions for the crypto market. Marshall Beard, COO of U.S. crypto exchange Gemini, recently told CNBC he expects Bitcoin to reach $150,000 later this year amid the confluence of factors like the halving, ETF launches, regulatory developments, and overall adoption and activity in the space.",
            "Back in March, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high,surpassing the $71,000 mark for the first time. This surge came on the heels of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority giving the green light to cryptocurrency exchange-traded products.",
            "The upward trajectory of Bitcoin\u2019s price gained momentum in January when theUnited States securities regulator approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds(ETFs). This approval was a catalyst for the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, which breached the $70,000 threshold just last week. In a similar vein, Ethereum (ETH) also achieved a significant milestone on Monday, crossing the $4,000 mark.",

            "The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued a warning about the high concentration of trading activity on a limited number of cryptocurrency exchanges.",
            "According to the regulator\u2019s analysis, a single platform, Binance, controls roughly half of the entire market, while just 10 exchanges handle about 90% of all cryptocurrency trades.",
            "The ESMA\u2019s report, released on Wednesday, also highlighted significant variations in market liquidity, with larger exchanges typically exhibiting higher levels of liquidity. While this concentration may offer efficiency benefits due to economies of scale, the regulator expressed considerable concerns about the potential implications of a failure or malfunction at a major asset or exchange for the wider crypto ecosystem.",
            "The ESMA\u2019s examination of the fiat currencies used within the crypto market revealed a strong dependence on the US dollar and the South Korean won, with the Euro playing a comparatively minor role, accounting for only about 10% of transactions. The regulator noted that the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation has not yet resulted in any observable increase in the use of the Euro within the cryptocurrency market. However, the ESMA expects that MiCA could potentially catalyze growth upon its implementation in 2024, given its focus on strengthening investor protection within the market.",
            "The regulator also challenged the notion of crypto assets serving as a safe haven during periods of broader market distress. The report identified a degree of co-movement between crypto assets and equities, while also highlighting the absence of a consistent relationship with gold, a traditionally recognized safe-haven asset.",
            "The ESMA emphasized the inherent opacity of crypto transactions, which makes it challenging to pinpoint their origin. However, a significant portion of crypto exchanges are found to be situated in jurisdictions characterized as tax havens. According to the regulator, roughly 55% of transactions are conducted on crypto exchanges licensed under the EU\u2019s VASP framework, although a substantial proportion of these transactions likely occur outside the European Union.",
            "The report also found that despite an increase in the number of actively traded crypto assets since 2020, the market remains highly concentrated. As of December 2023, just three cryptocurrencies \u2013 Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and the stablecoin Tether (USDT) \u2013 comprise a substantial 74% of the total market capitalization and 55% of the annual trading volume.",
            "The report follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse\u2019s recent prediction that the total market capitalization of the crypto industrycould double to $5 trillionby the end of 2023. In March, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high,surpassing $71,000 for the first time, following the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s approval of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products.",
            "The upward trend gained momentum in January when the US securities regulatorapproved spot Bitcoin ETFs, a catalyst for the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, which breached $70,000 last week. Ethereum also crossed the $4,000 mark on Monday.",

            "It's a lucrative scam with victims in multiple states, authorities warn.",
            "Prosecutors in Brooklyn seized nearly two dozen web domains associated with a scheme known as \"pig butchering,\" in which scammers strike online conversations with unsuspecting victims, gain their trust and then steer them into bogus cryptocurrency investments.",
            "Brooklyn-based victims were scammed out of at least $5 million after they were convinced to invest in cryptocurrency by someone they met through a random text message, a dating site or through a WhatsApp group, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office.",
            "The investments appeared to show tremendous returns, but when the victims tried to withdraw substantial sums they were blocked from their accounts and lost their entire investment, authorities say.",
            "The Brooklyn DA's office says it seized Coinformat.com and 20 other active associated domains in connection with the investigation into the scheme. Three virtual servers hosting those sites have also been seized.",
            "",
            "Authorities warn it's a lucrative and growing scam with victims in multiple states. The masterminds rely on human trafficking victims to help facilitate the scams at compounds in Southeast Asia, prosecutors say.",
            "\"Pig butchering is a growing type of scam that defrauds residents of Brooklyn and the entire country out of billions of dollars every year,\" Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said. \"My office's strategy is to disrupt these schemes by seizing and shutting down their online infrastructure, and to educate the public about ways to avoid becoming a victim. Awareness and education are the first and best lines of defense against these prolific scams. Investment returns that seem too good to be true are almost always just that \u2013 fake.\"",
            "The U.S. Justice Department last year announced it had seized virtual currencyworth an estimated $112 millionlinked to pig butchering scams.",
            "\"The victims in Pig Butchering schemes are referred to as 'pigs' by the scammers because the scammers will use elaborate storylines to 'fatten up' victims into believing they are in a romantic or otherwise close personal relationship,\" according to one affidavit for a search warrant in Los Angeles.",
            "The victims in the Brooklyn investigation include a 51-year-old woman who lost $23,000 after she was added to online chat groups discussing crypto investments, according to prosecutors. She downloaded an app from Coinformat, made eight deposits and believed her investment grew to nearly $400,000. When she tried to withdraw her initial investment, she was told by chat administrators that she had to pay taxes. When she complained, she was blocked from the chat group and her money disappeared.",
            "",
            "Prosecutors said her investment moved through multiple crypto addresses before it was deposited into an account at a foreign exchange and cashed out by someone possibly in China.",
            "The DA's office shared several warning signs of someone trying to lure a victim into a cryptocurrency scam. These include getting a \"wrong message\" text from a stranger trying to spark a friendship and talking about how much money they've made from a cryptocurrency investment. Potential victims are also added to group chats on WhatsApp or Telegram or solicited through Facebook by someone bragging about their crypto investments.",
            "Authorities warn people not to trust crypto investment opportunities that seem too good to be true and not to make crypto investments based on advice from strangers. Avoid downloading investment apps from unverified crypto investment websites, they say.",
            "Those in New York can check whether a cryptocurrency exchange is licensed to operate in the state by going to theDepartment of Financial Services' websiteor calling the department's hotline at 800-342-3736. People who believe they may have been victims are urged to contact their local FBI field office, call 1-800-CALL-FBI or report it to IC3.gov.",

            "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most well-known cryptocurrency, hasrecently undergone its fourth halving eventsince its creation.",
            "Halvings, which occur roughly every four years, are designed to reduce the number of new Bitcoin entering the market by cutting the rewards earned by Bitcoin miners in half. This mechanism is built into Bitcoin\u2019s code to cap the total supply at 21 million by the year 2140.",
            "The latest halving, which took place on April 23, 2023, has reduced the daily creation of Bitcoin from 900 to just 450. Previous halvings occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Despite the significant event, Bitcoin\u2019s price remained stable at $63,747 (\u00a351,531), as analysts believe the anticipated halving had already been priced in by the market.",
            "Investors are hopeful that the halving will eventually lead to significant gains, as has been the case with previous halvings. For example, after the May 2020 halving, when the price was around $8,600, Bitcoin surged to over $56,000 within a year. However, Andrew O\u2019Neill, a crypto expert at S&P Global, remains cautious about making price predictions based on previous halvings, stating that the halving is just one of many factors that can drive the price of Bitcoin.",
            "Bitcoin hit a new high of $73,803 (\u00a359,661) in March 2023, following a 175% increase over the previous 12 months. The cryptocurrency also gained legitimacy in January when Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) holding Bitcoin were allowed to be traded on the US stock exchange.",
            "Despite these milestones, the mainstream financial industry still views Bitcoin as a high-risk investment prone to unpredictable and dramatic price swings. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has warned that cryptocurrencies have \u201cno intrinsic value\u201d and that investors should be prepared to lose all their money. He also stated that crypto was \u201cpretty inefficient\u201d and not yet taking off as a core financial service.",
            "With more than 19.5 million Bitcoin already mined, only 1.5 million remain to be mined over the next 116 years. The halving mechanism, which occurs every 210,000 \u201cblocks,\u201d ensures a steady and controlled release of new Bitcoin into the market until the maximum supply is reached.",
            "The development follows crypto minersstockpiling near-record amounts of Bitcoin, hoping the token will rise in value and offset a drop in new supply that will cut the rewards for verifying transactions in half. Fees for transactions on the network have alsosignificantly decreased following the halving.",

            "According todata from TradingView, Bitcoin\u2019s price witnessed a surge to $67,000 following the latest daily close, with bulls maintaining a tight range and moving away from order book liquidity for the BTC/USD pair.",
            "Current figures from the blockchain data platform CoinGlassreveal that approximately $35 million worth of bid walls were absorbed at the daily close on Binance, with most of the selling liquidity now positioned between $67,000 and $67,500.",
            "An accompanying chart also displayed trading behavior among various Bitcoin whale classes. Interestingly, unlike others, the $1-10 million order category increased risk until April. This aligns with current data from research firm Santiment, indicating that FOMO is now prevalent among wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins.Santiment posted on X:",
            "Bitcoin\u2019s key whale tier holding 1K-10K $BTC are supporting this rise, and have now accumulated 266K more $BTC since the start of 2024. This translates to an accumulation of 1.24% of the entire supply. The crowd is also showing a high degree of #FOMO.",

            "BTC is right smack in the middle 60/73k range and BTC front-end vols have trickled down closer to 60% [\u2026] Just last week, we had the fourth BTC halving and the market was panicking over the outbreak of war in the Middle East (which has since de-escalated).",
            "What can we make of this unsettling quietness in the market?",
            "While market participants showed great anticipation of the Bitcoin halving, the price action failed to deliver on that premise. Reports indicate that Bitcoin minersstarted stockpiling near-record amounts of Bitcoin, hoping the token will rise in value and offset a drop in new supply that will cut the rewards for verifying transactions in half.",
            "Still, so far the price is very near where it was before the halving \u2014 currently at about $66,000 \u2014 and eventransaction fees have fallen sharply following the event.",

            "New cryptocurrency and cloud-mining platformBitcoin Minetrixis nearing the $13 million mark in its token presale, passing 85% of the $15 million fundraising goal stated in itswhitepaper.",
            "This milestone comes around two weeks before the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, adding to the project\u2019s timeliness and relevance within the crypto mining ecosystem.",
            "Bitcoin Minetrixis a project that aims to make Bitcoin mining more accessible by introducing a stake-to-mine concept. Rather than requiring expensive hardware and substantial electricity costs associated with traditional Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin Minetrix allows users to mine Bitcoin by staking native $BTCMTX tokens on the platform\u2019s website.",
            "In return, users receive non-transferable ERC20 token credits, which can be exchanged for Bitcoin cloud mining time or a portion of Bitcoin mining yields, granting the user full decentralized control.",

            "",
            "Once these mining credits are converted into Bitcoin, users can transfer it to their personal wallets or sell it on exchanges. Essentially, Bitcoin Minetrix offers a tokenized cloud-mining system where users deposit $BTCMTX tokens to receive cloud-mining credits, creating a pay-as-you-go mining model.",
            "Bitcoin Minetrix is also a user-friendly and efficient tokenized cloud mining platform. While traditional Bitcoin mining presents challenges for casual users and cloud mining is rife with scams, BTCMTX aims to level the playing field, enabling anyone to safely participate in mining the world\u2019s largest crypto, and earn staking rewards on the $BTCMTX token.",
            "The Bitcoin Minetrix project aims to raise $15 million through its token presale. The presale involves 39 stages, with incremental increases in token price, starting from $0.0110 per token up to $0.0148.",
            "The total supply of$BTCMTX tokensis 4 billion. Of the tokens sold in the presale, 42.5% will fund Bitcoin mining operations, 35% will be allocated for marketing, 15% for community initiatives, and 7.5% for staking rewards.",
            "",
            "Source \u2013bitcoinminetrix.com",
            "To purchase $BTCMTX tokens, users need an Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask. The tokens can be bought using ETH, BNB, MATIC, USDT, or a card.",
            "The need for solutions like Bitcoin Minetrix arises from the limitations of individual hardware mining. Consider the substantial yearly expenses, often exceeding $10,000 or more, required for suitable mining rigs and the significant electricity costs, especially as mining difficulties increase. Profitability relies on avoiding disruptions in this physically demanding process.",
            "While cloud mining services attempt to resolve hardware issues, they frequently underdeliver with opaque practices, and wrongful withholding of funds is widespread across hyped platforms offering unrealistic bitcoin contracts.",
            "Moreover, even profitable services must contend with the massive energy consumption associated with Bitcoin mining.According to Digiconomist, the energy consumption for securing the Bitcoin blockchain network reaches an astounding 160 TWh per year, rivaling the energy consumption of small nations. This highlights the extreme strain mining places on physical resources.",
            "As the premier Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency, Bitcoin requires tremendous computing power to confirm transactions. However, the environmental effects and barriers preventing widespread participation reveal why better systems like Bitcoin Minetrix should emerge.",
            "According to a report by JPMorgan, Bitcoin mining is poised to see higher profitability ahead of the upcoming halving event. The network\u2019s average daily hashrate, a measure of the computational power used for mining and transaction processing, reached a new peak of 600 EH/s (exahash per second) in March.",
            "This figure reflects a 4% increase from February and an 80% year-over-year growth. The increase in hashrate indicates not only growing competition among miners but also the industry\u2019s resilience and optimism, as noted in the report.",
            "The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins, casts uncertainty over mining profitability in the future despite the positive trends. In April, the halving could lead to a decline in profitability unless offset by a strong rally in Bitcoin\u2019s price or a dramatic decrease in the network\u2019s hashrate, according to JPMorgan.",
            "Bitcoin Minetrix potentially presents an intriguing solution to the challenges associated with traditional Bitcoin mining. By offering a tokenized cloud-mining model, the platform aims to make mining more accessible to a wider audience while addressing issues like high hardware costs, electricity expenses, and environmental concerns.",
            "As the project approaches $13 million raised in its presale, it demonstrates the growing interest in this crypto mining approach ahead of the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving later this month.",

            "Cryptocurrency miners are stockpiling near-record amounts of Bitcoin, hoping the token will rise in value and offset a drop in new supply that will cut the rewards for verifying transactions in half,according to a recent Financial Times report.",
            "Major listed miners like Marathon Digital, CleanSpark, and Bitfarms have collectively hoarded Bitcoin worth around $2.8 billion, according to data from The Miner Mag. This comes just days before the reward for mining is cut in half.",
            "After the change, which is set to take place on Friday, global miners will only receive 450 BTC daily (3.125 BTC per block) for verifying the latest transactions, down from the current 900. This quadrennial adjustment was built into the creation of cryptocurrency as a way to hedge against inflation.",
            "Hedge funds have been betting against listed crypto miners, anticipating that the halving will likely hurt their profitability. As a result, their share prices have fallen this year.",
            "The industry spends heavily on energy and technology to compete for new Bitcoin, and less efficient miners are expected to be pushed out of the market as production costs rise. Larisa Yarovaya, associate professor of finance at the University of Southampton commented:",
            "Mining companies are playing a constant game of chicken with each other. [\u2026] It\u2019s a business model that\u2019s based more than ever on faith that bitcoin\u2019s price will go up and demand for it will grow.",
            "To offset the decline in mining rewards, crypto executives and traders are betting that Bitcoin, which hit a record high last month, will continue to rise in value this year, following a trend established after previous \u201chalvings.\u201d",
            "Miners are currently holding 46,200 BTC in reserve, the highest recorded level since May 2022, when a market-wide crash forced them to sell their holdings, according to The Miner Mag.",
            "Major US-based miners have significantly increased their Bitcoin hoards. CleanSpark held over 5,000 BTC at the end of March, a 2,400% increase from the same period a year earlier. Marathon Digital has grown its holdings by 50% to 17,300 BTC, while Bitfarms and Riot have increased their holdings by 50% and 20%, respectively. Matthew Schultz, executive chair at mining firm CleanSpark said:",
            "Everyone is hopeful Bitcoin will go up in value and that will solve rewards being cut in half.",
            "This optimism has been fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s 121% rise in the past six months, as US regulators approved stock market funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin surged to a record high of $73,800 in mid-March but has since dropped more than 14% to below $60,000. Asher Genoot, chief executive of US miner Hut 8:",
            "Bitcoin is going to be worth more in the future than it is today.",
            "Miners have struggled with profitability after a debt-fueled expansion during the 2021 crypto bull market was curtailed by a crash. However, as the latest halving approached, they spent over $1 billion on new equipment to gain market share and squeeze out competitors.",
            "Despite the miners\u2019 optimism, hedge fund short sellers continue to maintain sizeable bets against a number of them. About 24% of Marathon\u2019s shares are out on loan, indicating strong short interest, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Short interest in Hut 8 has risen this year from less than 10% to over 14%, while bets against Riot Platforms have dipped slightly but remain above 19%.",
            "Miners are also hoping that increased activity on the Bitcoin network, such as the trading of non-fungible tokens, will boost their transaction fee revenue. However, experts caution that it is too early to tell whether this will be sufficient to keep mining activity economically viable in the long run.",
            "The report follows an early Bitcoin minermoving 50 Satoshi-era BTCin a widely covered transaction. The Bitcoin mining industry was also in the spotlight in mid-March, when President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed 30% tax on crypto mining power faced criticism forpotentially harming the industry and erasing investor wealth.",

            "The recent release of the second version whitepaper byBlockDAGhas spotlighted its trajectory towards achieving $5 million in daily financial inflows, amidst the dynamic market activities of Shiba Inu and PUSHD. While Shiba Inu experiences a minor decline, its future looks promising with expectations of a value surge. Simultaneously, the PUSHD presale is revolutionizing the e-commerce sector by offering a decentralized platform for transactions. BlockDAG stands out through its innovative blend of blockchain technology and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), aiming for fast transaction speeds and vast scalability.",
            "To date, the platform has attracted more than $15.6 million, with its cryptocurrency value reaching $0.0045 in the latest presale round. The growing investor confidence in BlockDAG, reflected in the anticipation of its daily inflows reaching $5 million, is explored in this analysis, focusing on the investment prospects of these three digital currencies.",
            "",
            "The past week has witnessed an 8% decrease in Shiba Inu\u2019s price, placing it slightly behind its competition. However, financial analysts remain optimistic about its future, attributing their positivity to a symmetrical triangle pattern observed on the 6-hour trading chart. This pattern, characterized by reducing highs and rising lows, suggests a period of consolidation that could lead to an upward trend in value.",
            "Should Shiba Inu continue to follow this pattern, its value could potentially double, aiming for a new price target of $0.000044. Furthermore, the SHIB ecosystem is alive with activity, as seen by the elimination of over 15.5 billion tokens, indicating a surge in participation.",
            "",
            "As the e-commerce industry is projected to surpass $6.5 trillion by 2024, PUSHD is set to capitalize on this growth. Operating as a decentralized entity on web3, PUSHD facilitates direct cryptocurrency transactions between merchants and customers, mirroring the functionalities of well-known e-commerce platforms.",
            "PUSHD grants users complete autonomy, enabling vendors to auction their products or set fixed prices. The current presale phase, which is the sixth, has set the token price at $0.135, drawing considerable interest from investors and highlighting its potential for significant influence.",
            "",
            "BlockDAG, having collected over $15.6 million by its 8th presale, exemplifies an innovative confluence of blockchain and DAG technologies. This synergy offers scalability and transactional speed, while maintaining the reliable security features of traditional blockchains. DAG\u2019s architecture allows for near-instant transaction confirmations, eliminating the typical mining delays and facilitating real-time application use.",
            "As a beacon of decentralized innovation, BlockDAG facilitates the creation of smart contracts and automated workflows. The unveiling of its Version 2 Whitepaper in Las Vegas has marked a significant milestone, showcasing BlockDAG\u2019s technological advancements.",
            "",
            "Experts anticipate BlockDAG\u2019s daily financial inflows to rise from $1 million to $5 million, signaling a robust faith and interest from the investment community in this dual-technology approach. BlockDAG\u2019s integration strategy positions it as a pioneer in the ongoing blockchain evolution, combining the rapid transaction capability of Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAG) with the security and efficiency of Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms.",
            "The digital currency landscape offers numerous investment opportunities, from the promising future of Shiba Inu to PUSHD\u2019s innovative approach to e-commerce. Among these, BlockDAG\u2019s distinctive blend of blockchain and DAG technology stands out for its promise of enhanced efficiency and scalability. The significant increase in its cryptocurrency value, from $0.001 to $0.0045 by its 8th presale, highlights the platform\u2019s strong presale performance and potential. With BlockDAG\u2019s expected daily inflow reaching $5 million, its state-of-the-art technology is not only captivating investor interest but also cementing its position in the blockchain sector.",

            "Are you looking to profit in the blockchain space?BlockDAG (BDAG)\u2018s whitepaper, highlighting key innovations, has supercharged its presale to an impressive $15.3M, attracting attention from crypto whales racing for 30,000x ROI and signaling a significant shift in blockchain technology.",
            "This development contrasts sharply with the cautiously optimistic outlook for Polygon (MATIC) in 2024 and the current dip in PEPE\u2019s price. BlockDAG sets itself apart, promising an era of breakthrough growth up to 30,000x and unparalleled efficiency with its cutting-edge technology.",
            "Polygon (MATIC) has dipped below $0.9 as the cryptocurrency market faces a downturn, sparking discussions on its future. The Polygon (MATIC) prediction 2024 hinges on critical technical and on-chain indicators. Currently, at long-term support within an ascending channel, the MATIC price shows potential for a short-term bounce toward $1.13, influenced by bullish divergences on the four-hour chart.",
            "On-chain data suggesting an accumulation phase and the anticipation of the Napoli upgrade could bolster the Polygon (MATIC) prediction for 2024. With the MVRV ratio indicating possible accumulation and trading above key support levels, the Polygon (MATIC) prediction for 2024 looks cautiously optimistic. It forecasts a rebound that could challenge the $1.0 mark, provided it maintains above the $0.88 support.",
            "",
            "In the past four days, the PEPE price has plummeted by 26.5%, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s pullback from $71.3k to $65.5k. This decline is underscored by bearish technical indicators, with the RSI and OBV both suggesting that selling pressure is dominating. The critical support level for PEPE is at $0.00000581; a drop below this could shift the market structure to bearish.",
            "Additionally, a significant decrease in daily active addresses and a low-weighted sentiment highlight reduced crowd participation and potential sell-off signs. Despite these indicators, the bullish market structure remains intact for now, but the future of PEPE\u2019s price hangs in the balance, requiring close monitoring by holders.",
            "",
            "BlockDAG is a beacon of blockchain innovation, swiftly securing its place in cryptocurrency with a remarkable presale achievement of over $15.3 Million and over 7 Billion coins sold. This signifies strong investor interest and marks BlockDAG\u2019s commitment to redefining the landscape with its cutting-edge Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology.",
            "Achieving unparalleled transaction speeds ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 per second, BlockDAG doesn\u2019t just promise efficiency and scalability; it ensures robust security across various industries, including logistics, supply chain, insurance, digital identity, and lending platforms, all under one decentralized financial ecosystem.",
            "",
            "With the eighth batch of sales nearing completion and coins attractively priced at $0.0045, the impending ninth batch sees a price adjustment to $0.005, reflecting growing investor confidence. This initiative is far more than a mere cryptocurrency endeavor; it\u2019s a visionary project with the ambition for a 30,000x potential, reimagining the future of blockchain technologies.",
            "The enthusiasm for BlockDAG is further elaborated upon releasing theTechnical Whitepaper, highlighted by an enormous display on the Las Vegas Sphere. It is proof of the project\u2019s bold ambition and the community\u2019s trust in its revolutionary promise.",
            "In comparison to the uncertainties surrounding Polygon (MATIC) prediction 2024\u00a0 and PEPE\u2019s price, BlockDAG is, in fact, the optimal choice for investors. With its innovative Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, robust security measures, and a clear vision supported by crypto whales, BlockDAG not only promises efficiency and scalability but also stands on the cusp of a 30,000x potential surge, marking a new era of blockchain potential.",

            "BlockDAGis rapidly gaining prominence, ranking alongside Solana, Avalanche, Cardano, Binance, and Uniswap among the top 6 leading cryptos of 2024. The buzz around an upcoming lunar keynote display, its novel DAG technology, and an effective presale campaign fuel this rise.",

            "Solana continues to be a robust platform for decentralized applications, thanks to its high-speed blockchain capable of processing up to 50,000 transactions per second at minimal cost. Combining Proof of Stake and Proof of History, Solana scales efficiently while remaining user-friendly, attracting both developers and investors with its potent capabilities.",

            "The Slothana presale has been been in high demand, raising over $15 million. Ituses a simplified presale model that has appealed to investors. By sending SOL tokens from their crypto wallets, users can reserve SLOTH tokens at a rate of 10,000 SLOTH per SOL invested.",
            "They then receive their tokens via airdrop after the presale concludes on April 29. All that remains is to check their decentralized wallet \u2013 Phantom, Solflare, Trust, Coinbase Wallet etc. \u2013 and import the token to view it.",

            "The goal is to transform the lazy office sloth, tired of the monotonous 9-to-5 routine, into a successful crypto trader through the SLOTH token. This narrative reflects the desire of many to break free from conventional work structures and embrace the dynamic and promising landscape of digital assets.",
            "Slothana has been actively promoting its project through various crypto channels that feature new airdrops and presales, including 99Bitcoins, CaptainAltcoin, Cointelegraph, Cryptonomist, CryptonewsZ, CryptoPotato, CryptoSlate and evenBusiness Insider.",
            "These collaborations have helped Slothana reach a wider audience and generate buzz within the cryptocurrency community.",
            "Moreover, the project has garnered positive attention from influential figures as well. For instance, Matthew Perry, a prominent YouTuber with over 210k subscribers, referred to Slothana as \u201ca banger\u201d in one of his latest videos, and predicts it may \u20185x at launch\u2019.",

            "Google hassuedtwo app developers based in China over an alleged scheme targeting 100,000 users globally over four years with at least 87 fraudulent cryptocurrency and other investor apps distributed through the Play Store.",
            "The tech giant alleged that scammers lured victims with \"promises of high returns\" from \"seemingly legitimate\" apps offering investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies and other products. Commonly known as \"pig-butchering schemes,\" these scams displayed fake returns on investments, but when users went to withdraw the funds, they discovered they could not.",
            "In some cases, Google alleged, developers would \"double down on the scheme by requesting various fees and other payments from victims that were supposedly necessary for the victims to recover their principal investments and purported gains.\"",
            "Google accused the app developers\u2014Yunfeng Sun (also known as \u201cAlphonse Sun\u201d) and Hongnam Cheung (also known as \u201cZhang Hongnim\u201d and \u201cStanford Fischer\u201d)\u2014of conspiring to commit \"hundreds of acts of wire fraud\" to further \"an unlawful pattern of racketeering activity\" that siphoned up to $75,000 from each user successfully scammed.",
            "Google was able to piece together the elaborate alleged scheme because the developers used a wide array of Google products and services to target victims, Google said, including Google Play, Voice, Workspace, and YouTube, breaching each one's terms of service. Perhaps most notably, the Google Play Store's developer program policies \"forbid developers to upload to Google Play 'apps that expose users to deceptive or harmful financial products and services,' including harmful products and services 'related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies.'\"",
            "In addition to harming Google consumers, Google claimed that each product and service's reputation would continue to be harmed unless the US district court in New York ordered a permanent injunction stopping developers from using any Google products or services.",
            "\"By using Google Play to conduct their fraud scheme,\" scammers \"have threatened the integrity of Google Play and the user experience,\" Google alleged. \"By using other Google products to support their scheme,\" the scammers \"also threaten the safety and integrity of those other products, including YouTube, Workspace, and Google Voice.\"",
            "Google's lawsuit is the company's most recent attempt to block fraudsters from targeting Google products by suing individuals directly, Bloombergnoted. Last year, Google sued five people accused of distributing a fake Bard AI chatbot that instead downloaded malware to Google users' devices, Bloombergreported.",
            "Google said that the accused developers \"varied their approach from app to app\" when allegedly trying to scam users out of thousands of dollars but primarily relied on three methods to lure victims.",
            "The first method relied on sending text messages using Google Voice\u2014such as \"I am Sophia, do you remember me?\" or \"I miss you all the time, how are your parents Mike?\"\u2014\"to convince the targeted victims that they were sent to the wrong number.\" From there, the scammers would apparently establish \"friendships\" or \"romantic relationships\" with victims before moving the conversation to apps like WhatsApp, where they would \"offer to guide the victim through the investment process, often reassuring the victim of any doubts they had about the apps.\" These supposed friends, Google claimed, would \"then disappear once the victim tried to withdraw funds.\"",
            "Another strategy allegedly employed by scammers relied on videos posted to platforms like YouTube, where fake investment opportunities would be promoted, promising \"rates of return\" as high as \"two percent daily.\"",
            "The third tactic, Google said, pushed bogus affiliate marketing campaigns, promising users commissions for \"signing up additional users.\" These apps, Google claimed, were advertised on social media as \"a guaranteed and easy way to earn money.\"",
            "Once a victim was drawn into using one of the fraudulent apps, \"user interfaces sought to convince victims that they were maintaining balances on the app and that they were earning 'returns' on their investments,\" Google said.",
            "Occasionally, users would be allowed to withdraw small amounts, convincing them that it was safe to invest more money, but \"later attempts to withdraw purported returns simply did not work.\" And sometimes the scammers would \"bilk\" victims out of \"even more money,\" Google said, by requesting additional funds be submitted to make a withdrawal.",
            "\"Some demands\" for additional funds, Google found, asked for anywhere \"from 10 to 30 percent to cover purported commissions and/or taxes.\" Victims, of course, \"still did not receive their withdrawal requests even after these additional fees were paid,\" Google said.",
            "Google tried to remove apps as soon as they were discovered to be fraudulent, but Google claimed that scammers concocted new aliases and infrastructure to \"obfuscate their connection to suspended fraudulent apps.\" Because scammers relied on so many different Google services, Google was able to connect the scheme to the accused developers through various business records.",
            "Fraudulent apps named in the complaint include fake cryptocurrency exchanges called TionRT and SkypeWallet. To make the exchanges appear legitimate, scammers put out press releases on newswire services and created YouTube videos likely relying on actors to portray company leadership.",
            "In one YouTube video promoting SkypeWallet, the supposed co-founder of Skype Coin uses the name \"Romser Bennett,\" which is the same name used for the supposed founder of another fraudulent app called OTCAI2.0, Google said. In each video, a completely different presumed hired actor plays the part of \"Romser Bennett.\" In other videos, Google found the exact same actor plays an engineer named \"Rodriguez\" for one app and a technical leader named \"William Bryant\" for another app.",
            "Another fraudulent app that was flagged by Google was called the Starlight app. Promoted on TikTok and Instagram, Google said, that app promised \"that users could earn commissions by simply watching videos.\"",
            "The Starlight app was downloaded approximately 23,000 times and seemingly primarily targeted users in Ghana, allegedly scamming at least 6,000 Ghanian users out of initial investment capital that they were told was required before they could start earning money on the app.",
            "Across all 87 fraudulent apps that Google has removed, Google estimated that approximately 100,000 users were victimized, including approximately 8,700 in the United States.",
            "Currently, Google is not aware of any live apps in the Play Store connected to the alleged scheme, the complaint said, but scammers intent on furthering the scheme \"will continue to harm Google and Google Play users\" without a permanent injunction, Google warned.",

            "Rodriguez was Samourai's CEO, and Hill was its CTO. They founded the company in 2015, according to the indictment, and the app has been downloaded over 100,000 times. All told, it netted them $4.5 million in transaction fees, according to the indictment.",
            "\"The FBI is committed to exposing covert financial schemes and ensuring no one can hide behind a screen to perpetuate financial wrongdoing,\" FBI Assistant Director James Smith said in a statement.",
            "Lawyers haven't been listed for either Rodriguez or Hill and an attorney who has represented their company in the past did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. If convicted, they each face a maximum of 25 years in prison.",

            "It's easy to get the impression that Discord chat messages are ephemeral, especially across different public servers, where lines fly upward at a near-unreadable pace. But someone claims to be catching and compiling that data and is offering packages that can track more than 600 million users across more than 14,000 servers.",
            "Joseph Cox at 404 Media confirmedthat Spy Pet, a service that sells access to a database of purportedly 3 billion Discord messages, offers data \"credits\" to customers who pay in bitcoin, ethereum, or other cryptocurrency. Searching individual users will reveal the servers that Spy Pet can track them across, a raw and exportable table of their messages, and connected accounts, such as GitHub. Ominously, Spy Pet lists more than 86,000 other servers in which it has \"no bots,\" but \"we know it exists.\"",
            "As Cox notes, Discord doesn't make messages inside server channels, like blog posts or unlocked social media feeds, easy to publicly access and search. But many Discord users many not expect their messages, server memberships, bans, or other data to be grabbed by a bot, compiled, and sold to anybody wishing to pin them all on a particular user. 404 Media confirmed the service's function with multiple user examples. Private messages are not mentioned by Spy Pet and are presumably still secure.",
            "Spy Pet openly asks those training AI models, or \"federal agents looking for a new source of intel,\" to contact them for deals. As noted by 404 Media and confirmed by Ars, clicking on the \"Request Removal\" link playsa clip of J. Jonah Jameson fromSpider-Man(the Tobey Maguire/Sam Raimi version) laughing at the idea of advance payment before an abrupt \"You're serious?\" Users of Spy Pet, however, are assured of \"secure and confidential\" searches, with random usernames.",
            "This author found nearly every public Discord he had ever dropped into for research or reporting in Spy Pet's server list. Those who haven't paid for message access can only see fairly benign public-facing elements, like stickers, emojis, and charted member totals over time. But as an indication of the reach of Spy Pet's scraping, it's an effective warning, or enticement, depending on your goals.",
            "Ars has reached out to Spy Pet for comment and will update this post if we receive a response. A Discord spokesperson told Ars that the company is investigating whether Spy Pet violated its terms of service and community guidelines. It will take \"appropriate steps to enforce our policies,\" the company said, and could not provide further comment.",

            "According to areport released by Fidelity Digital Assets on Monday, the number of Bitcoin wallets holding $1,000 or more has experienced a significant 20% increase since the beginning of 2024.",
            "This ongoing accumulation among smaller addresses reached a record high of 10.6 million on March 13, nearly doubling from 5.3 million in 2023, representing a 101% rise.",
            "Despite the upward trend in Bitcoin prices, this sustained increase in smaller addresses acquiring and holding the cryptocurrency may indicate a growing distribution and adoption among the \u201caverage\u201d person. However, Fidelity noted that price appreciation during the period and address consolidation might affect the accuracy of these figures.",
            "As of April 25, Bitcoin has seen an impressive 89% surge in the past six months, with its last trading price around $64,150.",
            "The Fidelity report also highlighted a decrease in the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges since its peak in 2020. Various exchange failures in 2022 and other problematic practices have driven the popularity of self-custody among Bitcoin holders throughout 2023. This trend continued in Q1 2024, with exchange balances further declining to nearly 2.3 million BTC, marking a 30% decrease from all-time highs and a 4.2% decline over Q1 2024:",
            "Fueled by multiple major exchange collapses in 2022 and other troubled exchange practices, self-custody has become a major part of the bitcoin journey throughout 2023. Q1 2024 was no different as balances on exchanges continued to dwindle.",
            "Fidelity emphasized the importance of monitoring the drop in available Bitcoin on exchanges in 2024, as it underscores the significance of alternative custody methods like self-custody. However, the decrease in exchange balances does not necessarily indicate a corresponding increase in self-custody.",
            "The report also addressed changes in the net position of holders, who typically hold Bitcoin for the long term. From Q3 to Q4 2023, the average net position dropped from 40,442 BTC to 31,376, with a notable decline at the end of 2023. Despite a slight recovery in late February, this group continued to experience significant outflows, possibly influenced by Bitcoin\u2019s new all-time high.",
            "This occurrence before the halving is unusual compared to past cycles, suggesting that these investors may perceive Bitcoin as being heavily overvalued before the halving. Current outflows amount to about 124,001 BTC, challenging the traditional Bitcoin halving pattern.",
            "The situation following this latest halving event is significantly different from the past, when the price saw a significant increase. Bitcoin has seenits price remain stable, andeven its fees fallfollowing the event.",

            "According to a Coindesk report, Singapore-based crypto services provider Matrixport noted that this investment vehicle could potentially unlock up to $25 billion in demand from Chinese investors through the Southbound Stock Connect program, which allows qualified mainland Chinese investors to access eligible shares listed in Hong Kong.",
            "Matrixport\u2019s report suggests that the approval of Hong Kong-listed Bitcoin Spot ETFs could attract several billion dollars of capital from mainland investors, as the Southbound Connect program facilitates up to 500 billion RMB (HK$540 billion and $70 billion) per year in transactions. Based on the potential available capacity, Matrixport estimates that up to HK$200 billion (US$25 billion) could be channeled into these Bitcoin ETFs.",
            "The Stock Connect program allows mainland Chinese investors to purchase up to HK$540 billion worth of Chinese stocks annually. However, data from 360MarketIQ reveals that flows in the past three years have fallen short of the limit by HK$100 to HK$200 billion ($15 billion to $25 billion), leaving a potential quota for Bitcoin ETF investment flows if the approval occurs without restrictions.",
            "It remains unclear whether the forthcoming spot ETFs will be accessible to mainland Chinese investors. However, mainland China\u2019s recent surge in gold prices suggests an interest in diversifying into alternative assets. The tightly controlled Chinese renminbi has declined nearly 2% against the U.S. dollar, extending its two-year losing streak due to economic slowdown and shrinking trade surplus.",
            "Nick Ruck, COO of ContentFi Labs, noted that mainland-based funds have been applying to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs through their Hong Kong subsidiaries, which could allow qualified mainland investors greater access to Bitcoin if approved.",
            "According to Nikkei Asia, top Chinese fund managers such as Bosera Asset Management\u2019s Hong Kong arm, Harvest Global Investments, and Value Partners, owned by Chinese brokerage GF Holdings, have applied for ETFs in Hong Kong.",
            "The U.S. recently approved nearly a dozen spot ETFs, which have amassed $12 billion in investor funds and pushed Bitcoin to new record highs above $73,000. If Hong Kong follows suit, it could lead to a significant inflow of capital from Chinese investors into the cryptocurrency market.",
            "In the United States, thelocal regulators approved the Bitcoin spot ETFback in January after a prolonged fight by proponents. ThoseETFs saw major outflowsfollowing a recent market setback after previouslyreporting over $1 billion of inflows in a single dayback in mid-March.",

            "This long-awaited license is a significant win for Binance, which has faced a series of regulatory challenges over the past two years. The exchange was forced to pay $4.3 billion in penalties to U.S. authorities in November, and as part of the deal, Zhao was required to step down as CEO.",
            "The VASP license allows Binance to offer a broader range of services to customers in the emirate, including retail cryptocurrency trading. Prior to this, Binance\u2019s local unit, Binance FZE, had held \u201cOperational MVP\u201d licenses for broker-dealer and exchange services since mid-2023.",
            "One of the final conditions set by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) before granting the full VASP license was for Zhao to relinquish his voting control of Binance FZE. Officials wanted to ensure that the Dubai operations would align with the agreement Binance reached with U.S. authorities, under which Zhao was forced to resign as CEO.",
            "After resolving the issue of Zhao\u2019s voting control, Binance and VARA conducted a comprehensive review of the products the exchange plans to offer in Dubai. The billionaire Zhao remains the ultimate beneficial owner of Binance FZE\u2019s Abu Dhabi-based parent company, according to the people familiar with the matter.",
            "The VASP license comes as Binance\u2019s smaller competitors, such as OKX and Crypto.com, have already obtained the coveted status, allowing them to serve a broader customer base in Dubai.",
            "Binance\u2019s new CEO, Richard Teng, has vowed to improve the company\u2019s compliance and relations with regulators worldwide. In the past year, several countries, including India and Belgium, have taken steps to prevent Binance from operating locally without the necessary approvals.",
            "Teng has stated that Binance, which does not have a formal headquarters, is in discussions with various jurisdictions about potentially serving as a global base for the company.",

            "TheU.K. Home Office announced on Friday (Apr 26)that these new rules, which stem from acrime bill passed by Parliament last year, have come into effect. Under the new regulations, police officers in the U.K. will no longer need to arrest confiscating crypto assets\u00e7",
            "Greater powers for the National Crime Agency and police to seize, freeze and destroy cryptoassets used by criminals have come into force today.",
            "This change aims to streamline the process of seizing criminally obtained assets, even when sophisticated criminals manage to conceal their identities or operate from overseas locations. The U.K. police force has already deployed crypto tactical advisors nationwide and has successfully seized crypto worthhundreds of millions of pounds.",
            "In a notable case from January, the country\u2019s National Crime Agency collaborated with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate a drug enterprise, resulting in the seizure of$150 million in cash and crypto. Chief Crown Prosecutor Adrian Foster emphasized the importance of these new measures in enabling investigators and prosecutors to keep pace with the evolving nature of crime.",
            "The seized crypto assets will be transferred to wallets controlled by law enforcement agencies, and officers will have the authority to destroy these assets if reintroducing them into circulation is deemed detrimental to the public good. Privacy coins, in particular, were highlighted as an example of asset types that may be destroyed after a seizure.",
            "Home Secretary James Cleverly underscored the significance of these reforms in enhancing national security, noting that terrorist organizations like Daesh are known to exploit crypto transactions for fundraising purposes. The updated powers will enable agencies to more effectively strip these groups of their assets.",
            "The development follows recent reports thatthe United Kingdom Treasury plans to introduce a regulatory framework for cryptocurrenciesand stablecoins by July 2024. The UK has been hard at work on crypto regulation for a good while and back in late October 2023 itreleased its\u00a0definitive guidelines for the cryptocurrency sector, with intentions to enact legislation in stages starting this year.",

            "Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has given the green light to the first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the region,according to an official announcement.",
            "This significant development has been confirmed by several official announcements from prominent financial institutions such as China Asset Management Co. (China AMC), Harvest Global Investments, Bosera International, and HashKey Capital. The newsfollows recent reportsthat Singapore-based crypto services provider Matrixport noted that this investment vehicle could potentially unlock up to $25 billion in demand from Chinese investors through the Southbound Stock Connect program, which allows qualified mainland Chinese investors to access eligible shares listed in Hong Kong.",
            "The SFC has granted China AMC\u2019s Hong Kong subsidiary the rights to offer digital asset management services to investors. The firm intends to launch ETF products linked to spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), in partnership with OSL Digital Securities, a digital asset platform, and Bank of China International-Prudential Trustee Limited (BOCI-Prudential Trustee Limited), serving as the custodian. The news comes afterVanEck CEO Jan van Eck recently voiced his skepticismregarding the approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May.",
            "Similarly, Harvest Global Investments has received in-principle approval from the SFC for two spot crypto ETFs, which will be issued in collaboration with OSL. The company believes that these new products will effectively address issues such as high margin requirements, price premiums caused by the absence of short sellers, and losses from rolling positions, providing investors with a more accurate reflection of the immediate value of Bitcoin.",
            "Bosera International and HashKey Capital have also reportedly been given the go-ahead to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, with the two companies announcing their strategic cooperation during the 2024 Hong Kong Web3 Festival on April 6.",
            "The cryptocurrency market has responded positively to the news of the ETF approvals. Bitcoin price has rebounded and is currently trading at $66,321, up 2.4% from the previous day, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum price has also been boosted by the announcement, trading at $3,250 at the time of writing, representing a 5.2% increase within the past 24 hours.",
            "The approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Hong Kong marks a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and is expected to attract more institutional investors to the digital asset space. As the first jurisdiction in Asia to approve such products, Hong Kong is positioning itself as a leader in the rapidly evolving world of digital finance.",

            "Jared is a former trader for Lehman Brothers, the editor of The Daily Dirtnap, a market newsletter for investment professionals, and the author ofNo Worries: How to Live a Stress-Free Financial Life. Today on the show, Jared talks about the two biggest sources of financial stress \u2014 debt and risk \u2014 and how you can eliminate the stress they can cause. We discuss how three big financial decisions \u2014 buying a car, buying a house, and managing student loans \u2014 ultimately determine your financial health, and how to approach each of them in a stress-eliminating way. We also talk about how to minimize risk by creating what he calls an \u201cawesome portfolio,\u201d a mix of assets that has nearly the return of the stock market with half its risk. And Jared shares whether cryptocurrency fits into his \u201cno worries\u201d financial philosophy.",

            "VanEck CEO Jan van Eck has voiced his skepticism regarding the approval of spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May.",
            "During a recentinterview with CNBC on April 9, the boss of the multi-billion dollar investment company stated that he believes his firm\u2019s spot Ethereum ETF application will \u201cprobably be rejected.\u201d VanEck and ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, were among the pioneers in filing for a spot in Ethereum ETF in the United States. Both companies are currently awaiting the SEC\u2019s final decision, which is scheduled for May 23 and May 24, respectively.",
            "Van Eck shed light on the regulatory process, explaining that regulators typically provide comments on ETF applications. However, in the case of Ethereum, there has been a notable absence of feedback. CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti shared a similar pessimistic outlook, stating that he does not anticipate any approvals in the near future.",
            "The SEC has been silent on the seven pending applications for spot Ethereum ETFs, contributing to the decreasing likelihood of an ETF approval in May. This \u201cradio silence\u201d between the regulator and prospective fund issuers has been noted by commentators, including Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.",
            "At the same time, the SEC hasinitiated a three-week comment periodfor three Ethereum spot ETF proposals submitted by Grayscale Investments, Fidelity, and Bitwise earlier this month. The announcement also follows theSEC discussing the Ethereum spot ETFproposed by asset manager Grayscale Investments with Coinbase back in March.",
            "VanEck\u2019s Ethereum ETF application is one of seven awaiting approval, alongside those from Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity. Balchunas, who initially assigned a 70% chance of approval in May, has since revised his odds to 35%. He echoed van Eck\u2019s sentiments, emphasizing the need for the SEC to provide comments and critical feedback.",
            "ETF analyst James Seyffart alsoexpressed concern over the SEC\u2019s months-long inaction, questioning the reasons behind the lack of communication when the applications were anticipated.",
            "Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs in the United States have experienced a shift in investor sentiment,with net outflows recordedsince the start of the week following four consecutive days of inflows and a day seeingover $1 billion of inflows. Grayscale\u2019s GBTC spot ETF was the primary contributor to this reversal, with single-day net outflows exceeding $303 million on Monday and an additional $154 million on Tuesday.",
            "Despite the outflows from GBTC, other Bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows during this period, with BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF leading the charge. VanEck\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, traded under the ticker HODL, currently ranks as the fifth largest among the ten recently launched funds, excluding Grayscale. Since its mid-January launch, HODL has attracted an inflow of $461.7 million, according to Farside Investors data.",
            "Van Eck highlighted the success of Bitcoin ETFs, describing Bitcoin as a \u201cmaturing asset\u201d and noting that there are still many investors who have yet to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.",

The disclosure revealed a profitable network of phishing sites that behave and look like the real Privnote, except that any messages containing cryptocurrency addresses will be automatically altered to include a different payment address controlled by the scammers.",
            "The real Privnote, at privnote.com.",
            "Launched in 2008, privnote.com employs technology that encrypts each message so that even Privnote itselfcannot read its contents. And it doesn\u2019t send or receive messages. Creating a message merely generates a link. When that link is clicked or visited, the service warns that the message will be gone forever after it is read.",
            "Privnote\u2019s ease-of-use and popularity among cryptocurrency enthusiasts has made ita perennial target of phishers, who erect Privnote clones that function more or less as advertised but also quietly inject their own cryptocurrency payment addresses when a note is created that contains crypto wallets.",

Searching DomainTools for domains that include both of these terms revealspirwnote[.]com.",

Pirwnote[.]com is currently selling security cameras made by the Chinese manufacturerHikvision, via an Internet address based in Hong Kong.",
            "It appears someone has gone to great lengths to make tornote[.]io seem like a legitimate website. For example,this account at Mediumhas authored more than a dozen blog posts in the past year singing the praises of Tornote as a secure, self-destructing messaging service. However,testingshowstornote[.]io will also replace any cryptocurrency addresses in messages with their own payment address.",

Like other phishing sites tied to this network, Tornote will use the same cryptocurrency addresses for roughly 5 days, and then rotate in new payment addresses.",

            "Throughout 2023, Tornote was hosted with the Russian providerDDoS-Guard, at the Internet address186.2.163[.]216. A review of the passive DNS records tied to this address shows that apart from subdomains dedicated to tornote[.]io, the main other domain at this address washkleaks[.]ml.",

Virtually all of those domains were registered through one of two registrars \u2014 Hong Kong-basedNicenicand Singapore-basedWebCC\u2014 and almost all appear to be phishing or pill-spam related.",

When I worked for a popular online retailer we used a service like this and shut down dozens of phishing sites over the years. It seems to me like Privnote needs to do more to protect their brand and a good first step would be to hire one of these providers.",

You get root/ access, yes it could be a VPS but the customer ~ owns the IP for the duration of the contract. So if these sites were seen at the same time on the same ddos-guard IP they are likely tied to the same customer \u2014 unless the customer was renting out their server to 3rd parties. If they were observed on the IP at different times, all bets are off \u2014 it could be different customers.",

            "She's speaking to a scammer from Nigeria on the other end of the line who is after her money. For months, he's spent a rough total of 20 hours on the phone with her, professing his love as he tries to get her to invest her millions in a house on the Moon. But the rambling Edna has been testing his patience with her absurd questions and tangents.",
            "When the scammer insists they marry in Nigeria, a place he says he's never been, Kitboga drops the act.",

The na\u00efve Edna character is one of the many disguises devised by Kitboga, the alias of a computer software engineer-turned-Twitch streamer, to lure scammers into his traps.",
            "Kitboga, also called Kit, is a millennial with a knack for improvisation. He's among the most popular of so-called scam baiters, a term used to describe those who aim to waste scammers' time otherwise spent ripping off innocent victims. It's a lucrative gig for some of the biggest creators in the genre who, like Kit, have quit their jobs to scam bait full-time, often broadcasting their humorous schemes on YouTube and Twitch. As internet scams spike, with victims losing more money than ever, scam baiters like Kitboga are trying to get more than just laughs.",
            "Americans lost a record $12.5 billion to internet crimes last year, according to the FBI's latestannual report, marking a 22% jump from 2022. The bureau says that number is likely higher because so many crimes go unreported. Law enforcement agencies lack the resources to investigate the majority of internet-based fraud, and few victims see their money returned.",
            "But, like others in the world of scam baiting, Kitboga figures that the longer he can keep fraudsters on the line, the fewer victims fall prey to these scams.",
            "Kitboga reveals the ridiculous lengths scammers will go to steal from the vulnerable. The episodes lend themselves to teaching moments for the viewers tuned into his streams. He breaks down the latest scams he encounters, from his own investigations or tips from his subscribers, sometimes learning as he goes. To his 1.2 million Twitch followers \u2014 a count he's doubled on YouTube \u2014 he's shed light on some of the most rampant and costliest cyber threats, from tech support and gift card fraud, topig butchering scams. Pig butchering is a combination of a romance and an investment scam, usually involving cryptocurrency, in which the scammer slowly works to gain the trust of their victim before convincing them to invest money they'll never get back.",
            "\"Getting emails from someone saying, 'I knew that this was a scam because of your video,' ends up being a really cool mission-accomplished type feeling,\" Kitboga said.",
            "It wasn't so long ago that Kitboga himself was ignorant of the types of scams he now encounters daily.",
            "He was inspired to start scambaiting in 2017, after coming across a YouTube clip of\"Lenny,\" a beloved chatbotdesigned to trick telemarketers into thinking they are talking to a live person. The bot was an early scam baiter: Lenny wastes the time of spammers and scammers as the recorded voice of a forgetful old man spits out lines prompted by pauses on the other end.",
            "It was then that Kit realized that tech support scams were a thing. He thought of his grandmother, whose dementia made her a more vulnerable target, and his grandfather with Alzheimer's.",
            "\"I work on computers all day. If I don't know this exists, my grandparents definitely don't know,\" he said. \"And there was just this spark of maybe I could do something about it.\"",
            "Scammers had been taking advantage of his grandmother, he learned. She was paying for multiple cable and internet packages. He said \"sketchy\" people were showing up at her house on her dime, doing unnecessary tasks.",
            "But as Edna, a character modeled after his grandma, he realized he could manipulate the scammers.",
            "\"The initial drive or mission was, if I spent 10 minutes on the phone, then that was 10 minutes that that scammer wasn't talking to my grandma or your grandma,\" he said.",
            "Friends encouraged him to stream his calls with scammers on Twitch. Since then, he said he's helped several victims escape the hold of scammers and disrupted large fraud operations.",
            "On a good day, Kitboga gathers enough intel from the scammer that he then reports to the authorities. Scammers, seeing him as an unsuspecting victim, will occasionally give up bank account details, cryptocurrency wallet addresses and other identifying information that he said he shares in his reports to banking authorities, in complaints to the FBI, and in direct communications with law enforcement.",
            "\"If they think you're falling for their scams, they end up giving way too much information sometimes,\" he said.",
            "A post shared by Kitboga(@kitbogashow)",
            "The FBI and the Secret Service did not confirm to NPR whether it has agents working with Kitboga or any other scam bait streamers, saying it doesn't comment on specific activities. The bureau encourages victims to promptly report online scams to its Internet Crime Complaint Center, iC3.gov. The FBI uses those complaints to build cases against cybercriminals. Of the small percentage of overall crimes it does look into, the bureau has a relatively high success rate of stopping scams. Last year, the FBI's recovery unit was able to freeze roughly 71% of the $758 million stolen in fraud crimes it investigated.",
            "As to how to fight fraud, strategies differ among scam baiters. The ethics of how far to take the trolling are debated in online forums. Some have questioned the murky practices of Pierogi, the alias of another popular streamer in the scambaiting world, who is known for having more of a vigilante streak. Another has faced legal repercussions for his tactics. Thomas Dorsher, who ran the YouTube channel ScammerBlaster to document his efforts in punishing illegal robocallers, wasfined by the FCCfor running his own illegal robocalling scheme.",
            "Among scam baiters, Kitboga is known for toeing the line: \"I kind of treat it like, well, if it's illegal for me I shouldn't do it,\" he said.",
            "Even so, Jerri Williams, a retired FBI agent, advises scam baiters to be cautious. As a veteran fraud investigator who has worked major telemarketing cases, she said, \"I wouldn't recommend this at all.\"",
            "You don't always know who's on the other side of the phone. Although streamers largely target call center scammers who have rudimentary hacking skills, there's a chance it could be a con artist capable of doxing the scam baiter, Williams said. Some scammers, she added, are not willingly defrauding people, but arevictims of human trafficking operations.",
            "\"When you're playing around with people whose job it is to be a criminal, you need to really think about what are you attempting to do,\" she said. \"If it's truly just to entertain followers then, no, I don't think it's the right thing to do at all.\"",
            "For many people who watch Kit's content, the amusement factor was the Trojan Horse to real information they say helps them stay alert to scams.",
            "Dylon Cai, 40, said he's a lot wiser to the various scams out there after coming across Kitboga's channel. Years ago, he was ensnared in a tech support scam that caused him to lose all of his college work on his laptop.",
            "\"It was frustrating,\" he said. \"At that time, YouTube was just starting out. I really wish that somebody was actually able to share this kind of content to me. That would have prevented that experience I had.\"",
            "Cindy, who doesn't want to use her last name due to the threat of scams, said scammers hounded her late parents' phone line after she became the executor of their estates. A search for answers took her to Kitboga's Twitch stream.",
            "\"I started off trying to find solutions but then I began to love the entertainment portion of it,\" she said. \"He's just very addictive to watch and I get a little schadenfreude from seeing [scammers] get their comeuppance.\"",
            "Cindy, who at 64 is on the older side of the scam baiter's predominately millennial viewership, has since joined Kit's team of volunteers, helping promote his content and keep track of his anti-scam sagas. She said her husband, who doesn't watch Kit's content, now looks to her when he's confronted with suspicious activity online.",
            "\"He comes to me, he's like, 'What's this?' And I'm like, 'Oh, that's a scam,' \" she said. \"I feel empowered, you know.\"",
            "A post shared by Kitboga(@kitbogashow)",
            "Kit has taken a more proactive approach in his latest schemes, which haveallowed him to thwart scammers even while he's sleeping. He'sset up a \"honeypot\" trap, created with artificial intelligence, that sends scammers through a series of unending verification stepsin search of non-existent stolen Bitcoin accounts.",
            "Recently, he also released anti-scam software. \"I've seen how devastating they [scams] can be,\" Kitboga said, \"but also learned \u2014 going back to my grandma \u2014 how I could stop someone from ever getting on her computer in the first place.\"",

            "With just days to go before this year's income tax deadline, cybercriminals are looking to take advantage of procrastinators.",
            "April 15 is coming fast. Time to get your taxes done. But watch out for scams.",
            "There's just a few days left before this year's deadline to file your income taxes, and security experts say procrastinators should beware. They need to take care that they don't fall for tax-related scams and other attempts to steal their refunds and personal information.",
            "For most of the country, this year'sfederal income tax deadlinefalls on April 15. Residents of Massachusetts and Maine have until April 17 because of holidays in their states. The more you wait till the last minute, the more likely you are to fall victim to some kind of tax-related cybercrime.",
            "\"For folks who may be scrambling and feel pressure to move quickly, I recommend that they don't let that pressure cause them to make quick decisions,\" said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit group that helps victims of identity theft.",
            "She added that last-minute filers should still take the time to do their homework when doing things like selecting a tax preparer ortax preparation software. Something as simple as clicking on a dubious link or unwittingly inputting your personal information into a scam website could put a filer at risk for financial fraud oridentity theft.",
            "Unsolicited offers of help filing taxes, especially those promising big refunds, should be met with skepticism.",
            "But spotting scammers is getting increasingly harder, thanks to artificial intelligence technology, which makes it easier for cybercriminals to send out sophisticated scams at a previously unseen scale, said Vijay Balasubramaniyan, CEO of Pindrop Security, which focuses on AI technology.",
            "\"Tax season is a stressful time for all,\" Balasubramaniyan said. \"Add AI and deepfakes into the equation and it's easy to get overwhelmed by all the potential threats.\"",
            "Sherrod DeGrippo, director of threat intelligence strategy at Microsoft, said scammers are creating fake websites -- some that impersonate well-known tax prep and financial services companies -- to try to trick filers into uploading their tax return information.",
            "They also often try to impersonate the IRS. Phishing emails, texts and even phone calls designed to look like they're from the IRS, or an IRS agent, are a common sight this time of year. They might threaten jail time or big fines if the targeted person doesn't pay what the cybercriminals might claim are back or overdue taxes.",
            "The IRS only uses the U.S. Postal Service to reach people. Any other method of communication is a sure sign of a scam.",
            "\"The IRS will never send you an email to initiate contact,\" DeGrippo said. \"Nor will they use text messages or any kind of social media account to contact you.\"",
            "The IRS also doesn't take payments in the form of cryptocurrency or gift cards, making requests for back taxes in those forms obvious signs of a scam too.",
            "Here are a few tipsfrom the IRSand others for staying alert.",
            "File early:OK, the ship may have already sort of sailed on this one, but the earlier you file, the less time cybercriminals have to use your identity to commit fraud. Don't forget, if you need more time. you can file for an extension. Better to do that and give yourself some breathing room rather than rush and fall for tax-themed fraud, DeGrippo said.",
            "Watch out for phishing and smishing:The IRS won't send unsolicited emails or texts. Skip the links and attachments and gostraight to the IRSor the applicable state and city websites. In general, don't reply to emails or texts sent from unknown sources, Balasubramaniyan says. And definitely don't open attachments from people you don't know or send them your personal information like your Social Security number or tax ID.",
            "Get a PIN:File this tip under things to remember for next year. Taxpayers who can validate their identities with the IRS can obtain an identity protection PIN, a six-digit code that prevents a cybercriminal from filing a fraudulent tax return with your Social Security number.",
            "Fight back against fraud:If you discover someone has filed a tax return in your name, complete a paper return and include form 14039 (Identity Theft Affidavit). Report the fraud to local law enforcement and the Federal Trade Commission. Monitor your credit reports and account statements and contact the three major credit bureaus to ask for a freeze so that no one can request new credit in your name.",
            "Always use good passwords and 2FA: These are both a must for any account related to your tax returns and documents. Make sure you're usinggood antivirus softwareand that it, along with your operating system, is up to date. While you're at it, back up your tax information to a removable drive or encrypted cloud storage. Paper copies and drives should be securely stored.",
            "Know who you're dealing with:If you're self-filing online, make sure you're using a reputable service. If you hire someone to do it for you, make sure they're who they say they are. Velasquez recommends checking credentials and qualifications using theIRS Directory of Federal Tax Return Preparers. Be especially careful when submitting documents. Encrypted email isn't enough. Any decent tax professional or service will use a secure portal, she said.",
            "Shred everything:Tax documents that are no longer needed must be properly destroyed. Dumpster diving still happens. Don't be tempted to toss them in the trash and don't put them in the recycling."

            "Two former Apple employees who worked for the company as cybersecurity researchers are now launching their own startup. CalledDoubleYou, the startup is focused on helping creators of cybersecurity products protect iOS devices and Macs.",
            "The startup was founded by Patrick Wardle and Mikhail Sosonkin. Wardle worked at the US National Security Agency between 2006 and 2008 before becoming an independent security researcher specializing in macOS. Sosonkin, on the other hand, worked on Apple\u2019s security team between 2019 and 2021.",
            "They consider themselves \u201clong time friends\u201d with extensive knowledge of security on Apple platforms. In an interview withTechCrunch, the researchers said that the idea of founding DoubleYou came after they realized that there are few security products for macOS and iOS. In contrast, both platforms have become increasingly targeted by malicious hackers.",
            "TheDoubleYouteam wants to use techniques frequently used by hackers to attack Apple systems to apply them as defense tools. The researchers say they\u2019re developing a method for analyzing all macOS processes to detect and block any untrusted code, as well as monitoring and blocking anomalies in DNS traffic.",
            "The startup\u2019s founders also want to create tools to monitor and block software such as cryptocurrency miners and ransomware. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to use new technology to make this work. What we need is to actually take the tools available and put them in the right place,\u201d Sosonkin said.",
            "Although the researchers want their startup to grow in the future, they plan to remain independent for now as they \u201cjust want to catch some malware.\u201d",

            "The 32-year-old former billionaire was the poster boy for cryptocurrency,\u00a0 gracing magazine covers and enjoying audiences with lawmakers, before the speculator collapse of FTX in 2022 amid a deluge of customer withdrawals.",
            "Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyer Marc Mukasey had announced his intention to appeal the verdict and sentence during his sentencing hearing on March 28.",
            "During his sentencing, Bankman-Fried expressed regret over his handling of FTX, saying he was \u201csorry about what happened at every stage\u201d.",
            "\u201cIt haunts me every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a series of bad decisions.\u201d",
            "US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan said that Bankman-Fried had not shown genuine remorse or fully accepted responsibility and there was a \u201crisk that this man will be in position to do something very bad in the future\u201d.",
            "Prosecutors had asked for a prison sentence of 40-50 years, while Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers had requested the judge to impose a six-year term.",
            "Bankman-Fried\u2019s appeal could take years and would need to convince a higher court that Kaplan had made significant errors during the trial that infringed on his legal rights.",
            "US federal courts rarely side with criminal defendants attempting to overturn lower court decisions, granting fewer than 10 percent of appeals.",

            "ANDY MILLS (AM): I\u2019ve heard that Bitcoin is a hedge, like gold could be. Is that good advice? Should investors get involved in, in, in putting some risk into Bitcoin?",
            "DOUG COHEN (DC):So Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have thousands of years of history. It has like, I don\u2019t know, a dozen years or something like that. It is wildly speculative. A lot of the interactions are illicit and as I\u2019m kind of leading you, I\u2019m not a huge fan of it. I think it\u2019s mostly speculative. That being said, for an investor who wants to have a hedge, I think there are some legitimate arguments to having a small position in Bitcoin. It clearly has shown it has the ability to be a valuable hedge in times of uncertainty, but it\u2019s not really time tested. And still, at a very basic level, I struggle to understand how governments are going to allow a parallel system to develop that isn\u2019t heavily, heavily regulated. So we\u2019re kind of moving down that path a little bit here in the US while still opening up Bitcoin in some ways, including having ETFs, which are in the short term, have been helpful. I think it\u2019s speculative, it\u2019s not a bold statement, it is a speculative investment. If someone wants to have a little bit on the side, I think there\u2019s a case for doing that. Would I put a significant amount of my assets into Bitcoin? No, but I would\u2019ve told you that a while ago and you know, would\u2019ve been wrong with it. Trading close to $70,000 today.",
            "AM: So what do you think the future of Bitcoin is, five, ten years down the road? Is it a part of our regular financial system or does it take over as its own thing?",
            "DC:I still think it\u2019s gonna be sort of off to the side. I think it\u2019s gonna be kind of off to the side from a transactions perspective. So as you said, there\u2019s some, call it normalization of Bitcoin, but you still can\u2019t do a whole lot with it. There are a few retailers or different businesses that will accept it, but not very many. And there\u2019s still a lot of illicit activity that goes on around Bitcoin. And I think that comes back to what I was saying earlier, which is at some point I think governments, and it\u2019s not just Bitcoin, it\u2019s other cryptocurrencies as well. At some point I think governments are really going to want to make sure that they understand that everything is easily traceable, easily track-able, easily taxable if need be that people aren\u2019t avoiding taxes. And there are ways that can be done. The blockchain can be very effective in terms of tracking down some things. But we\u2019re not quite there yet. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really gonna be mainstream. What could be mainstream, not in three or five years, but maybe 15 or 20, is that we could certainly have digital currencies. The days of dollar bills could be numbered or at least minimized significantly. We could easily have digital transactions, but I think they would be Central Bank sponsored in a base, basically part of the official system.",
            "AM:That\u2019s really interesting. Thank you, Doug.",

            "Pete Rizzo is a leading Bitcoin Historian and author of over 2,000 articles on cryptocurrency. He is also an Editor at Bitcoin Magazine.",
            "The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and does not necessarily reflect the views of Kraken or its management. This opinion is not investment advice.",
            "Bitcoinwasn\u2019t created out of thin air. Decades of prior electronic cash projects failed, but each one built on the incremental progress the others had made. Bitcoin was the culmination of this process, a triumph shared by an entire scientific community.",
            "Some predecessors, like DigiCash, were too reliant on trusted authorities and so never gained market acceptance. Others, like HashCash, created working currencies backed by computer networks, but couldn\u2019t hold value over time.",
            "Finally, there were horror stories like Liberty Reserve, where the operators of working e-currencies were outright arrested and jailed for their work.",
            "All of these projects shared a common aim \u2013\u00a0to disrupt the government\u2019s monetary monopoly and create a viable internet currency free from central control.",
            "Many in the digital assets space agree that Bitcoin has achieved all of the above \u2013 and this makes it incredibly unlikely Bitcoin will ever be outcompeted by a government or private market alternative.",
            "Together, these accomplishments represent a value proposition that exceeds the sum of its parts. Even among thousands of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains unique.",
            "Satoshi\u2019s stroke of genius was the decision to use a prior invention called proof-of-work (PoW) to distribute bitcoin to any user willing to secure the network with computing power.",
            "To issue new bitcoins, Bitcoin users compete to solve mathematical puzzles using computer equipment, validating their work by expending electricity and resources. In return, they receive newly minted BTC in a process referred to as mining.",
            "This distribution created a level playing field and fostered a global community.",
            "Crucially, this system meant Nakamoto didn\u2019t need to sell, issue or market bitcoins. In 2011, he even turned over the operation of Bitcoin\u2019s software to an open-source developer community, none of whom he paid directly, or that received any form of financial compensation.",
            "Users earned bitcoins by offering a service to the protocol, trading energy for ownership, or by trading with each other directly. This design ensured that work was required to receive Bitcoin.",
            "Bitcoin\u2019s success was about more than creating a new money; it was about creating a system to distribute value in a way that couldn\u2019t be gamed and that didn\u2019t unfairly advantageanyuser. Even Satoshi mined all the Bitcoin he received, just like everyone else.",
            "Today Bitcoin\u2019s issuance remains a fair contest, but that is not the case for the many alternative cryptocurrencies circulating, which are still searching for an alternative to PoW.",
            "Many of them allocate the scarce data within their networks disproportionately, often via insider sales. This provides these advantaged users the ability to accrue more of the currency or to have a direct say in both the network\u2019s development and economic policies.",
            "Bitcoin is free from these fairness and manipulation concerns.",
            "At its core, Bitcoin is a system of rules for governing a global, distributed database that tracks the ownership of the data within its economy.",
            "For the network to operate effectively, many participants must retain and sync their copies of the database and agree that those copies are without discrepancies. Otherwise, like the electronic currencies of old, there is a risk that a user might be able to allocate data they don\u2019t own or didn\u2019t earn \u2013 fraudulently creating new coins and issuing them into circulation.",
            "Every Bitcoin competitor faces a problem: There is a direct relationship between the size of the database and the ability of network users to maintain their own copy of that database.",
            "Bitcoin makes thoughtful tradeoffs to keep this critical functionality accessible. You can think of every blockchain network as consisting of three types of actors:",
            "As with any cryptocurrency, these essential functions have barriers to entry. Crucially, however, Bitcoin\u2019s barriers are not the product of the protocol, but of market forces. Any user who wants to secure the database can do so by finding access to electricity and computing power. Any user who wants to verify the database can do so by downloading and storing its ledger.",
            "Both activities are influenced only by the market for computing resources.",
            "Other cryptocurrencies add features that increase the cost of executing these functions. Some allocate the ability to determine their cost to specific users, allowing the users that secure the database to dictate that their peers hold a certain amount of the cryptocurrency, or to meet some other criteria they dictate in order to receive the cryptocurrency.",
            "These sacrifices tend to reward wealth and influence \u2013 similar to government-run economies where the supply and distribution of money is not governed by market forces, but by a small number of individuals. Bitcoin, again, is free of these compromises.",
            "Property rights are defined asthe exclusive rightof an individual or organization to use, manage and dispose of a resource that they earned through their labor at their own discretion.",
            "While this may be intuitive to anyone living in a country that protects these rights, not everyone around the world is entitled to them. In some countries, even democratic ones, governments can freeze the bank accounts of individuals by using (or abusing) the legal system.",
            "This is another dilemma common to other cryptocurrencies. It is possible to add features to any cryptocurrency, or to change the rules, altering the allocations of ownership by forcing users to download a new, incompatible software.",
            "Bitcoin relies on making backwards-compatible upgrades to its software. This means that its developers prioritize changes that do not force users to upgrade. Users can run any software that is compatible with the Bitcoin network without sacrificing functionality (though this may come at the cost of security).",
            "Other cryptocurrencies often introduce incompatible changes to their software, where those who dissent from the change may no longer be able to enjoy the same benefits as others. Should you choose to reject the upgrade, your coins may not be accepted within the economy.",
            "Developers may measure user opinion when proposing incompatible softwares, but, ultimately, every user is at the mercy of the majority of other users.",
            "With Bitcoin, minority groups can stick with the older version, keeping their Bitcoin and its value intact, though they face security trade-offs. This allowance for differing opinions sets Bitcoin apart as a champion of property rights.",
            "As long as you hold the private keys to your Bitcoin, you are guaranteed ownership over these coins. As long as you are running any Bitcoin-compatible software, you can be sure you will be able to transact with those keys within the Bitcoin economy. Likewise, you can be sure there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins.",
            "All money is based on a social contract. Users agree to exchange their labor for a medium that they can use to freely acquire products and services at a later date.",
            "Monetary history has been dominated by two types of systems, both with different kinds of social contracts.",
            "Bitcoin is a market-based money, and it has all the characteristics that determine money:",
            "Because of its fair launch, open network, and strong property rights, Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy isn\u2019t just fixed, it\u2019s credible. Users can be assured it will remain unchanged, unless all of its millions of users agree on the change, however unlikely.",
            "Other cryptocurrencies, by contrast, offer variable monetary policies, with less credibility.",
            "Some change so often they are not dissimilar from government-managed monies, whose value can be subject to the whims of politics. Like central banks, they control the money supply and take actions that aim for price stability and economic growth.",
            "Others have no limits on their issuance, undermining their credibility.",
            "Likewise, global central banks use monetary policy tools to control the supply of their national currencies. As the Federal Reserve has shown, these institutions are vague about when and why these rates change. Often only insiders aid in the decision making.Those using stablecoins, dollar-backed crypto assets, or some formal form of central bank digital currency (CBDC), similarly, are only opting into this existing system.",
            "While the above qualities lay a strong foundation for Bitcoin, these attributes alone aren\u2019t enough to ensure it will never be replaced by an alternative. This is why its last attribute is perhaps the most important: Bitcoin\u2019s ability to change and improve.",
            "It appears unlikely Bitcoin can scale to provide its benefits to the world\u2019s eight billion people as constructed. Work needs to be done to develop additional, transactional layers that can expand Bitcoin\u2019s foundational capacity \u2013 without sacrificing its core value propositions.",
            "In the past year alone, Bitcoin developers have achieved feats never before thought possible, without changing the core code, unlockingTuring-complete smart contractsas well as new ways to transform bitcoins intonon-fungible tokens.",
            "The ability of Bitcoin users to successfully implement compelling new features makes existing crypto networks that offer similar functionalities redundant.",
            "In an expanding sea of competing cryptocurrencies and government-managed monies, with diverse and ever-changing policies, Bitcoin stands alone.",
            "Investing in crypto assets is risky and each token can have its own set of risks. Below is a list of risks that generally apply to all crypto assets:",
            "Volatility: The performance of crypto assets can be highly volatile, with their value dropping as quickly as it can rise. You should be prepared to lose all the money you invest in crypto assets.",
            "Lack of protections: Crypto asset investments are unregulated and neither the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) nor the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) will assist or protect you in the event that something goes wrong with your crypto asset investments.",

            "Complexity: Specific crypto assets may carry with them specific complex risks that are hard to understand. Do your own research, and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.",

That compares to 21% of respondents from those same age groups, on average, who said that they own crypto.",

            "Home prices climbed 6.4%in February compared with a year earlier, selling for a median price of $412,227, according to Redfin. Mortgage rates, too, have stayed elevated well above pre-pandemic levels as a result of the Federal Reserve bank\u2019s inflation-fighting campaign, which hasleft interest ratesat a 23-year-high of between 5.25% and 5.5%.",

Nearly two-thirds of Gen Z and millennials believe the stock market is agreat place to build wealth and invest, according to the Youth & Money in the USA poll carried out by CNBC and Generation Lab in late January. But many simply don\u2019t have enough savings or leftover cash to invest.",

            "Bitcoin prices have been on a roller-coaster rideover the past few months. Previous Bitcoin halving events have sent Bitcoin prices higher. But given its recent volatility, many experts say this time will be different \u2014 and thatthe cryptocurrency could even lose value after the halving.",
            "Bitcoin halvingis a technical event that cuts the reward for mining new Bitcoin by half. After April 19 or 20, the reward miners get for creating new Bitcoin will be cut in half, from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125. This happens every four years and will continue until all 21 million Bitcoin are mined. The feature is important to understand how Bitcoin functions.",
            "Halving was written into Bitcoin\u2019s code from the beginningto ensure scarcity and safeguard against inflation. Previoushalving events coincided with huge Bitcoin price increases.",
            "Here\u2019s what to know about the coming Bitcoin halving, as well as what it will mean for Bitcoin\u2019s price and more.",
            "Bitcoin is generated by miners who use computer hardware to solve complex mathematical problems and verify transactions on the blockchain network. In return, miners receive a predetermined amount of Bitcoin for each block of transactions they process.",
            "The reward, which is given to miners who verify the transaction, is a way to create more Bitcoin. The first Bitcoin block, also known as theGenesis Block, was created by Nakamoto in 2009and was rewarded with 50 Bitcoin.",
            "Bitcoin\u2019s supply is limited to a maximum of 21 million coins. This means no additional coins will be generated or created after reaching that 21 million limit. Nakamoto introduced the concept of Bitcoin halving to limit the quantity of the cryptocurrency and make it more valuable to combat inflation. That\u2019s why Bitcoin halving is important, as it prevents the uncontrolled creation of Bitcoin.",
            "The Bitcoin blockchain creates 210,000 new blocks in about four years, which is the standard established by its creators. The first reward was 50 bitcoin in 2009, when Bitcoin\u2019s price was almost 0.",
            "Bitcoin\u2019s next halving is expected to take on April 19-20, reducing the mining reward to 3.125 Bitcoin. The process will continue until roughly 2140. This means that after the 2024 halving, 29 more halving events will occur before the final reward of just one satoshi (the smallest unit of the Bitcoin) is granted.",
            "Bitcoin halving has historically boosted the priceof the cryptocurrency.",
            "For instance, after the first Bitcoin halving in 2012, the price was $12. It went up to $44 in 100 days, and then $135 in 300 days.",
            "Similarly, after the 2016 halving event, the flagship cryptocurrency went from $658 to $1,551 in 300 days.",
            "And in the most recent halving of 2020, the price of $8,601 went to $50,941 within 300 days.",
            "CoinGecko, a crypto tracking website,finds that Bitcoin\u2019s price has increased by 103,877%since 2013. Bitcoin was trading at about $70,000 in mid-April, just 4.4% off its all-time high reached on March 14, 2024.",
            "However, this year\u2019s halving event won\u2019t necessarily bring higher Bitcoin prices, as thetop cryptocurrency is undergoing a topsy-turvyphase, and banking giants likeJPMorgan have cautioned investors not to put too much hopein it.",
            "Satoshi Nakamoto set a cap on the supply of Bitcoin at 21 million, which limits the number of Bitcoin that can ever exist. As of March 2024, there were approximately 19.65 million Bitcoin in circulation, with only about 1.35 million left to be released through mining rewards. It is estimated that by 2140, when all 21 million Bitcoin will be mined, that the network will stop creating new bitcoins.",
            "Bitcoin miners generate revenue through block rewards and transaction fees. Once all 21 million Bitcoin have been mined, the block reward will decrease to zero. But miners could continue to earn an increasing portion of their income from transaction fees.",
            "After the Bitcoin halving, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This year, it will be reduced from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 Bitcoin.",
            "In the short run, the reduction in block rewards could potentially impact miners, requiring them to invest in more advanced mining equipment to remain competitive. That said, Bitcoin\u2019s price will likely rise, as it always has after previous halvings. So that means miners may earn enough profit even with a reduced Bitcoin reward.",
            "Bitcoin mining is notorious for consuming energy, leading to concernsamong climate activists seeking to ban it.An online tool from the University of Cambridge says thatBitcoin\u2019s annual energy consumption is equivalent to that of Switzerland.",
            "Experts have tried to find more eco-friendly ways to make Bitcoin, and there are concerns about how halving will impact electricity consumption.",
            "With every Bitcoin halving, the competition to verify transactions increases. This forces miners to upgrade to advanced ASIC miner rigs that maximize productivity and minimize power consumption. So Bitcoin halving can help a little \u2014 but it\u2019s definitely not \u201ca greener way\u201d for generating Bitcoin.",

            "Zac Brettler showed no signs of depression before he jumped to his death from a fifth-floor London balcony opposite MI6 headquarters at the age of 19, according to his parents.",
            "Rachelle and Matthew Brettler toldThe New Yorkerthat their son, an aspiring entrepreneur who attended a $38,000-a-year private school, had big plans for his future. He hadn't appeared to be suicidal, they said.",
            "But the fraudulent lifestyle he had built, resulting in peculiar friendships with crypto millionaire Akbar Shamji and gangster Verinder \"Dave\" Sharma, is shrouded in a mystery, according to multiple reports.",
            "Now, five years after his death, questions are being raised about the investigation into his last moments by London's Metropolitan Police.",
            "Brettler's story is a tale around deceit, money, and influence \u2014 and how quickly a seemingly ordinary teenager from a relatively wealthy background can, unbeknownst to his parents, become embroiled in a world far from his own.",
            "It was only after Brettler's death in November 2019 that his parents learned their son had a flair for fabricating his life story, according to reports.",
            "Brettler became obsessed with wealth during his school years and would often lie about his parents' occupations. It earned him a reputation as a \"compulsive liar,\" according to former classmates who spoke to The New Yorker.",
            "He used the alter-ego \"Zac Ismailov,\" and pretended to be the son of a dead Russian oligarch in order to befriend Shamji and Sharma, according to multiple reports.",
            "Shamji, 52, is a cryptocurrency trader and businessman who lived in Mayfair, one of London's wealthiest neighborhoods, when he met Brettler in 2019, according to The New Yorker. The two bonded over entrepreneurship and were even said to be business partners, having discussed launching a line of CBD-infused skincare products and investing in a Kazakhstan mine, the same outlet added.",
            "Sharma, meanwhile, was a gangster who lived in an apartment in Riverwalk, a luxury apartment complex in London. It's not clear how Brettler met Sharma, but they appeared to have a close relationship. Sharma allowed Brettler to stay at his home for a brief period after Brettler had fabricated a story about his mother barring him from the family's luxury properties, according to The New Yorker.",
            "The Sunday Timesreported that both Shamji and Sharma believed they would benefit from Brettler's fictional fortune. He told the men that his bank account was frozen, but he was worth \u00a36 billion, or around $7.5 billion, The Times reported.",
            "One evening, after growing suspicious of Brettler's story, the men agreed to confront him at Sharma's home, according to The Times report. But hours later, camera footage overlooking the property showed the teenager had jumped from the balcony into the River Thames.",
            "The reason why remains unclear, even as new clues are uncovered.",
            "A spokesperson for Metropolitan Police told Business Insider that it was unable to determine the reason that Brettler jumped following an inquest in December 2022. Nor have they sound evidence that Sharma or Shamji were involved.",
            "Sharma refused to be questioned by the police, giving 181 \"no comment\" responses, The Times said. Instead, he wrote a note saying Brettler had been suicidal.",
            "Related stories",
            "The publication added that both men failed to address the alleged dispute over the money.",
            "There's also the question of whether Brettler had felt threatened by the men, or someone else, in the days leading up to his death. An unnamed friend of Brettler's told The New Yorker that he believed he was \"being threatened by someone.\"",
            "A new investigation published by The Sunday Times on 7th April shared evidence about Shamji and Sharma's movements on the evening of Brettler's death, which is said to have been overlooked by a junior police officer \"who made errors in her analysis.\"",
            "During interviews with police in December 2019 and March 2020, Shamji told officers that he had left the apartment at midnight, traveling in a rented Mercedes. After the investigation into Brettler's death began, his story changed; he now claimed had left \"just after\" 1 a.m. for his home in Mayfair, The Times said.",
            "Data from the Mercedes' GPS tracker, phone records, and security camera footage published by The Times tell a different story.",
            "Security cameras showed Shamji leaving the apartment at 1:20 a.m. and starting his car at 1:50 a.m. While driving around London, he attempted to call Sharma but didn't receive a call back until 2.12 a.m., The Times reported.",
            "The evidence contradicts Sharma's account of events. He told police he was \"heavily intoxicated\" by 12:30 a.m., the outlet said.",
            "While the details of the phone conversation are not known, it was thought to have changed the trajectory of the evening. Shamji swiftly turned around and began driving at twice the legal speed limit, the report said. He arrived at the apartment at 2:23 a.m., within the same minute that Brettler was thought to have jumped, the outlet said.",
            "EXCLUSIVE \ud83d\udea8 The Sunday Times has obtained \"black box\" data from a tracking device inside the Mercedes rental car used by Akbar Shamji \u2014 a suspect in the case of teenager Zac Brettler's death.We have used its GPS data to create minute-by-minute reconstruction of his movements\u2026pic.twitter.com/lLAhhx5Anu",
            "At around 2:45 a.m., Shamji left the apartment again. Security camera footage shows he stopped opposite the spot where Brettler had fallen and looked out onto the water. According to The New Yorker, Shamji denied seeing Brettler's body in the water, saying he would have immediately called the police if he had.",
            "Brettler's body was discovered at around 7 a.m. the following morning. He had multiple injuries, including a broken jaw. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police told BI that a pathologist was unable to determine if Zac's broken jaw and some injuries were caused by the fall or a \"previous assault.\"",
            "Just over one year after Brettler's death, Sharma was found dead in his apartment in December 2020.",
            "The death wasn't ruled as suspicious, with various accounts being given on the cause. One informal explanation given to Brettler's parents was a drug overdose which could have been a suicide, according to another report byThe Timesin February. An unnamed associate told the outlet that Sharma had hit his head on the bathtub.",
            "A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said there will soon be an inquest into Sharma's death. They weren't able to provide a date or further details.",
            "Shamji moved to the US after Brettler's death, theDaily Mailreported. Though his current movements are largely a mystery, in 2022 he was publicly named as a speaker at the networking event Crypto Bahamas. Shamji did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment.",
            "In a statement initially sent to The Times and obtained by BI, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: \"We robustly challenge the assertion that there were 'serious errors and gross incompetence' in the investigation.\"",
            "They said the investigation into Brettler's death \"lasted a number of years and we dedicated significant resource to finding answers.\"",
            "When asked if it had made the errors outlined in the article, they said they would need to speak to the officer involved as well as review the evidence.",
            "Nonetheless, it appears unlikely that the investigation will reopen following The Times' report.",
            "\"We do not believe that any alleged GPS data errors, even if proven to be accurate, would present scope for changing the findings of the police investigation,\" the statement said.",
